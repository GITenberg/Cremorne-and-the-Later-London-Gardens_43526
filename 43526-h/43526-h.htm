<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> open-air resorts described in
this volume lack the romantic associations of the classic
pleasure-gardens of the eighteenth century, and it is impossible
to impart to Cremorne or the Surrey &lsquo;Zoo&rsquo; the
historic dignity of a Vauxhall or a Ranelagh.&nbsp; Yet, if these
places are undeserving of the detailed treatment that has been
accorded to their prototypes, they may claim at least a brief and
modest chronicle, which may seem the more necessary because it
has mainly to be constructed, not from books, but from stray
handbills and forgotten newspapers.&nbsp; Already, indeed, we are
growing accustomed to speak of the nineteenth century as the
&lsquo;last,&rsquo; and to recognize that the London of Dickens,
and Thackeray&mdash;the London of the thirties, the forties, and
even of the sixties&mdash;had a physiognomy of its own.</p>
<p>Such places of resort, for the most part, enjoyed no kind of
fashionable vogue; they were frequented (if invidious
distinctions must be made) by the lower middle classes and the
&lsquo;lower orders.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet they offer some curious
glimpses of manners and modes of recreation which may be worth
considering.&nbsp; I have endeavoured to describe some twenty of
these places, selecting those which seem, in various ways, to be
typical.&nbsp; To the general reader this selection will be
enough&mdash;though, I trust, not more than enough&mdash;but the
London topographer who turns to the appendix and the notes will
find a quite formidable list of tea-gardens and tavern-gardens,
which, if my aim had been to omit nothing, I could have described
in greater detail.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>I have
taken some pains in compiling these lists, partly from
topographical curiosity, partly from the conviction that their
enumeration almost rises to the dignity of pointing a
moral.&nbsp; The main contrast is between the tavern and
public-house of former days and the gin-palace, with whose
aspect&mdash;externally, if not (in any sense of the word)
internally&mdash;we are only too familiar.&nbsp; A description
that I have found in a London guide-book of 1846 of the tea and
tavern gardens of that date has already an old-world air:
&lsquo;The amusements are innocent, the indulgence temperate; and
a suitable mixture of female society renders it [our guide means
<i>them</i>] both gay and pleasing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The public-house
was then, as now, no inconspicuous feature of the Metropolis; yet
in the earlier half of the nineteenth century it had, if not
exactly gaiety and innocence, some characteristics which tended
in that direction&mdash;its little gardens in summer, its tavern
concerts in winter-time.&nbsp; In the fifties, or earlier, many
of these garden spaces&mdash;often, it is true, of Lilliputian
dimensions&mdash;were marked out as building-ground, which was
either sold to alien contractors or utilized by the proprietor of
the tavern when he thought fit to erect thereon a roomier and
more imposing edifice.&nbsp; At the same period, or some years
later, the increase of music-halls, of local theatres, and places
of entertainment, rendered the tavern concert, with its
unambitious glee-parties and comic singing, a superfluity.&nbsp;
The disappearance of the tavern concert may not be a matter of
keen regret, but the abolition of the garden has
altered&mdash;and for the worse&mdash;the whole character of the
public-house.</p>
<p>In the garden a man might sit with a friend or chance
acquaintance as long as his pleasure and a treacherous climate
permitted.&nbsp; In the gin-palace he practically cannot sit at
all, but is huddled, sometimes with his wife and children, into a
kind of pen, from which custom and a sort of shy politeness bid
him depart at the earliest moment to make room for
new-comers.&nbsp; The London public-house has thus become a mere
counter for the hurried consumption <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>of drink; it has lost any
convenience or merit it may once have had as an improvised club
and a cheerful resort.</p>
<p>The proprietors of the larger houses seem, indeed, to have had
a suspicion of this, for they sometimes offer, for the behoof of
their wealthier customers, a comfortable lounge or
smoking-saloon.&nbsp; But this does not benefit the humbler
classes, and it has often seemed to me that a good way of
discouraging intemperance in a great city is not to attempt the
heroic, unpopular, and impossible task of abolishing the traffic
in drink, but to compel the owners of licensed houses to dispense
their stock-in-trade under more rational and recreative
conditions&mdash;<i>to give us</i> &lsquo;<i>clubs</i>&rsquo;
<i>for</i> &lsquo;<i>pubs</i>,&rsquo; or, at any rate,
caf&eacute;s and caf&eacute;-restaurants.</p>
<p>We have our obvious models on the Continent in the large
caf&eacute;, the beer-garden, and even in the small
caf&eacute;.&nbsp; The poor man would not be &lsquo;robbed of his
beer,&rsquo; nor would the change be quite
&lsquo;un-English,&rsquo; as the record of our little tavern
gardens will show.&nbsp; Even in London at this moment there is
an (almost solitary) instance of a caf&eacute;-restaurant of this
kind, in Leicester Square.</p>
<p>The one feature common to all these Continental places is the
custom of sitting down at a table; there is no standing at a bar,
or the rapid displacement of one customer by another.&nbsp; The
coffee, the liqueur, or the lager, is not only
drained&mdash;shall I say, to its dregs?&mdash;but is spun out
and husbanded to the utmost, and for an hour or so there is at
least the semblance of the comfort and convenience of a club.</p>
<p>It is too late now to restore the little summer gardens, but
it should be possible to convert our public-houses, not into
coffee-palaces, which do not meet the general need, but into
caf&eacute;s, by which I mean places where varied drinks, strong
or otherwise, would be obtainable, though under less absurd and
demoralizing conditions than at present.&nbsp; Every one should
be made to sit down, should be waited on&mdash;by a waitress if
we like&mdash;and the great bar itself should be dissolved,
except as a counter for the attendants.&nbsp; There <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>could be
caf&eacute;s both large and small&mdash;places that the London
Baedeker would describe as (relatively) &lsquo;expensive,&rsquo;
and others to suit the pence of the people.&nbsp; The caf&eacute;
might even be musical, though perhaps a line would be drawn at
the <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i>.&nbsp; Probably many small places
would not be able to conform to these conditions, and would have
to be closed; but, in view of the diminished competition, the
larger houses could be called upon without hardship to undertake
the necessary reconstruction.</p>
<p>But I am converting this preface into a temperance pamphlet,
and, before is it too late, I break off to ask a kindly
consideration for a little volume which recalls, I think, some
interesting and not uninstructive features of old London
life.&nbsp; In reading the proof-sheets I have had the kind help
of my brother, Mr. A. E. Wroth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old house by the river had
often changed hands, but the new possessor, who was reputed to be
a Baron, somewhat puzzled the quiet inhabitants of Chelsea.&nbsp;
Great oaks and elms surrounded the grounds, but through the fine
iron gates, which were left half open, it was not
difficult&mdash;as on this summer morning of 1830&mdash;to catch
a glimpse of the owner, engaged, apparently, in the survey and
measurement of his estate.&nbsp; He was a man of over sixty,
dressed in a faded military uniform of no known pattern, but
which seemed to have done service in some company of
sharpshooters in the days of Napoleon.&nbsp; In the middle of the
lawn was a table, on which a rifle reposed amid a litter of plans
and papers.&nbsp; But if the Baron had a gun it was not to shoot
<i>you</i>, but one of the targets at the far end of the garden,
and his successive bull&rsquo;s-eyes certainly proclaimed the
hand of a master.&nbsp; A little intrusion he did not seem to
mind, and as you advanced he only offered you a prospectus:
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">The Stadium</span>, Cremorne House,
Chelsea, established for the tuition and practice of skilful and
manly exercises generally.&rsquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>The estate of Cremorne House (or Farm), which was afterwards
to be developed into the notorious Cremorne Gardens, had once
belonged to the pious Lady Huntingdon, and George Whitfield had
prayed and discoursed within the house.&nbsp; Later on, it passed
to the Earl of Cremorne, then to his widow, a descendant of
William Penn.&nbsp; The last <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>owner was Granville Penn. <a
name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a>&nbsp; The purchaser of 1830, in whom we
are interested, was Charles Random de Berenger, who styled
himself Baron de Beaufain, or, more often, the Baron de
Berenger.&nbsp; His name seemed French, but he boasted of ancient
Prussian lineage, and long before this date had settled in
London.&nbsp; He was a skilful draughtsman, an inventor of
peculiar guns <a name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b"
class="citation">[2b]</a> and explosives, and believed to be the
owner of innumerable patents, which had only brought him to a
debtors&rsquo; prison.&nbsp; In the summer of 1815 he had emerged
from a term of imprisonment in the King&rsquo;s Bench, for it was
he who with consummate skill and audacity had carried through the
great Stock Exchange hoax of 1814, in which Lord Cochrane and his
friends were so painfully involved. <a name="citation2c"></a><a
href="#footnote2c" class="citation">[2c]</a>&nbsp; In fifteen
years these things were nearly forgotten, and the Baron, who was
a sportsman and a dead shot, found himself well supported when he
opened his Cremorne Stadium in 1832.</p>

<p>The subscription was two or three guineas, and the members,
under the Baron&rsquo;s tuition, could shoot, box and fence, and
practise &lsquo;manly exercises generally&rsquo; in his beautiful
grounds.&nbsp; He also established, so to speak, a
&lsquo;Ladies&rsquo; Links,&rsquo; with its clubroom,
&lsquo;which Gentlemen cannot enter,&rsquo; unless (such is his
quaint proviso) &lsquo;by consent of the Ladies occupying
such.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1834 George Cruikshank made a design for a
&lsquo;Chelsea Stadium Shield,&rsquo; which was quite Homeric in
its form, and showed every conceivable kind of sport and
exercise, including pole-jumping and golf. <a

<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>The

with the adventitious aid of occasional galas and balloon
displays that already foreshadowed Cremorne. <a

</a></p>
<p>The transformation of this failing arena of British sport into
the full-blooded pleasure-garden of Cremorne was effected by
another Baron, though he was such only by the courtesy of Bow
Street and Maiden Lane.&nbsp; Renton Nicholson (for that was his
name), like most of the managers of Cremorne, was a man who knew
a thing or two.&nbsp; He was born early in the century, and his
boyhood was spent in the quiet village of Islington, where his
two sisters kept a <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>young ladies&rsquo; seminary.&nbsp; His tastes early led
him to the distractions of Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, and at sixteen,
<a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> when he became a pawnbroker&rsquo;s
assistant in Shadwell, he began to acquire his remarkable
knowledge of the &lsquo;flash&rsquo; life of London in all its
grades.&nbsp; About 1830 he opened a jeweller&rsquo;s shop in the
West End, which supplied the &lsquo;swells&rsquo; of the day and
their female friends, and by this time his London
acquaintanceships were extensive and peculiar, consisting, as we
are told, of shady journalists, players, tavern vocalists, and
rooks of all shades from the welsher to the skittle sharp.&nbsp;
He knew the taste of his public, and in 1837 began to issue the
scurrilous journal called <i>The Town</i>, for which Dr. Maginn
and other lively contributors used to write.&nbsp; After a minor
experience of gambling-houses and doubtful premises of various
kinds, he became (in 1841) proprietor of the Garrick&rsquo;s Head
in Bow Street, and here, in a room holding about 300 people, and
fitted up like a law-court, he presided&mdash;as Lord Chief Baron
Nicholson&mdash;over the judge and jury trials that were so
attractive to the Londoner of the forties and fifties.&nbsp; The
causes that came before this tribunal were chiefly
matrimonial&mdash;the <i>crim. con.</i> cases of the
time&mdash;and were such that their obscenity and heartlessness
(mitigated, it is true, by flashes of wit) often made the most
hardened sinner shudder.&nbsp; Nicholson presided over similar
trials at those famous haunts, the Coal Hole and the Cyder
Cellars, till his death in 1861.&nbsp; He was impudent in manner,
obese and sensual in appearance, yet a man of real talent and
geniality, gone hopelessly upon the wrong track.&nbsp; His
apologists describe him as a sort of nineteenth-century Robin
Hood, who plucked the aristocratic pigeon, but was &lsquo;the
soul of good nature&rsquo; to the poor Bohemian. <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>His
connexion with Cremorne was brief, and his capital
inadequate.&nbsp; In 1843 he replaced the timid prospectus of De
Berenger by flaming bills announcing a &lsquo;Thousand Guineas
F&ecirc;te,&rsquo; which during three days (July 31, August 1 and
2), at one shilling admission, provided, among other diversions,
a mock tournament, a pony-race, a performance by Tom Matthews the
clown, and a <i>pas de deux</i> by T. Ireland and Fanny
Matthews.</p>
<p>In 1845 De Berenger died, and this year Littlejohn (the
refreshment caterer to the gardens) and Tom Matthews managed the
place between them.&nbsp; Charles Green, the balloonist, was
called in, and began that long series of Cremorne ascents which a
spice of eccentricity and danger always rendered popular.&nbsp;
For example, in September, Green went up with a lady and a
leopard&mdash;the latter a magnificent animal, so perfectly
subdued in the presence of his mistress or her &lsquo;livery
servant,&rsquo; as to lay (according to the bill) at her feet or
crouch in her lap at command.&nbsp; In August the balloon party
consisted of Green, Lord George Beresford, and Tom Matthews, who
preluded the ascent by singing his &lsquo;Hot
Codlings.&rsquo;&nbsp; The balloon went up at seven, and, after
visiting the General Post Office and passing over Stamford Hill
in perilous proximity to the New River Reservoir, landed its
occupants, after a voyage of two hours, cold and shivering, on a
marsh at Tottenham.</p>
<p>In 1846 (or more probably a few years later) Cremorne was
purchased by Thomas Bartlett Simpson, who guided its destinies
till the beginning of the sixties. <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; Simpson had been
head-waiter at the Albion, a well-known theatrical <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>tavern that
stood opposite Drury Lane Theatre in Russell Street, and was
afterwards its lessee.&nbsp; He was a shrewd man of business,
and, according to George Augustus Sala, &lsquo;a kindly and
generous gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sala, who knew the gardens well
from about 1850, tells us that, unlike the Vauxhall of the time,
Cremorne was a real pleasaunce surrounded by magnificent trees,
with well-kept lawns and lovely flowers, and melodious
singing-birds.&nbsp; Nothing was pleasanter in the summer-time
than to saunter in at midday or in the early afternoon (for the
gardens were not properly open till three or five), and find Mr.
Simpson&rsquo;s daughters there with their work-baskets&mdash;to
say nothing of the pretty barmaids employed by the kindly and
generous gentleman, who were busy, in their cotton frocks,
arranging the bars, and paying, it is implied, no ordinary
attention to Mr. G. A. Sala.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Five thousand pounds was spent in preparing for the opening of
1846, and a banqueting-hall and theatre were constructed, as well
as some &lsquo;delightful lavender bowers&rsquo; for the
accommodation of the 1,500 persons who were likely to need a
bowery seclusion.&nbsp; The gardens were rapidly getting into
shape, and we can now survey them almost as they appeared till
their close in 1877.</p>
<p>They were about twelve acres, to which must be added, from
1850, the grounds of Ashburnham House on the west, in which
flower-shows and other exhibitions were held.&nbsp; Cremorne lay
between the river and the King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea.&nbsp; The
grand entrance was in the King&rsquo;s Road, where a big star
illuminated the pay-box.&nbsp; On a summer evening, if you did
not mind the slow progress of the threepenny steamer from the
City to Cremorne Pier, you entered by the river gate at the
south-east corner of the gardens.&nbsp; The grounds were well
lit, but on entering there was not that sudden blaze of light
that was the visitor&rsquo;s great sensation when he came through
the dark pay-entrance into the garden of Vauxhall.&nbsp; The most
conspicuous feature was the orchestra to the south-west of the
gardens&mdash;a &lsquo;monster <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>pagoda,&rsquo; brilliantly lighted
with hundreds of coloured lamps, and surrounded by a circular
platform, prepared, it is said, to accommodate 4,000
dancers.&nbsp; Here the dancing took place from 8.30 till 11 or
later.&nbsp; There was always a dignified master of the
ceremonies (in 1846 Flexmore the pantomimist), but little
introduction was required in that easygoing place.&nbsp; There
was a good band of fifty, for some years under Laurent, of the
Adelaide Gallery Casino in the Strand. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; In the early
part of the evening&mdash;at any rate, in the seventies&mdash;the
dancing was left to the shop-girls and their friends: the gilded
youth and the &lsquo;smart&rsquo; female set of Cremorne began
their waltzing later on, after the fireworks.</p>
<p>The gardens had a tendency to become congested with
side-shows, flaring stalls and shooting-galleries, too much
suggesting a fair; but, unlike Earl&rsquo;s Court and the later
Vauxhall, Cremorne remained a garden.&nbsp; There was still the
encircling fringe of ancient trees, and an avenue on the west
stretching from north to south; on the east side was the broad
lawn from which the balloon ascents took place.</p>
<p>Cremorne had the usual pleasure-garden equipment of fountains
and statuary; refreshment-bars, boxes, and tables were placed at
every coign of vantage, though the right place to go was the
Cremorne House (or Hotel) dining-room, or the upper and lower
tiers of supper-boxes in the south and south-western
corner.&nbsp; Here there was a half-crown supper, and, if you
aspired no higher, the Cremorne sherry, that fine old wine,
&lsquo;free from acidity, and highly recommended to
invalids.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the centre of the grounds was an
American bowling-saloon, which made its appearance, together with
American drinks, in &rsquo;48 or &rsquo;49.</p>
<p>On the west side was the circus; the theatre was in the south
of the garden.&nbsp; A smaller theatre, north of the lawn, was
appropriated to a troupe of marionettes, introduced by Simpson in
1852.&nbsp; They were great favourites of the public and of the
proprietor, who liked &lsquo;the little beggars who <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>never came to
the treasury on Saturday.&rsquo;&nbsp; Besides this, there was a
maze and (as Vauxhall had its hermit) a gipsy&rsquo;s tent and a
&lsquo;double-sighted youth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The admission to the
gardens was one shilling, and the season tickets cost one guinea
or two guineas.</p>
<p>Simpson&rsquo;s management (<i>i.e.</i>, till 1861) provided
some special diversions, of which the most curious, perhaps, was
an Aquatic Tournament or Naval F&ecirc;te (1851).&nbsp; About
eleven at night a fortress (either St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre or
Gibraltar) on the river esplanade was vigorously attacked by a
squadron consisting of fourteen steamers of the Citizen Company
(whose &lsquo;entire fleet&rsquo; was embarked in the
enterprise), seconded by the hull of a retired Citizen steamer,
which was laden with combustibles.&nbsp; To this attack the land
battery&mdash;its necessary smoke, fire, and noise supplied by
Mortram and Duffell, the Cremorne fireworkers&mdash;made a
suitable reply, and eventually the old hull was blown to pieces
amid the cheers of the spectators.</p>
<p>The Italian Salamander, &lsquo;Cristoforo Buono Core,&rsquo;
was, later on, in 1858, another attraction of a fiery kind.&nbsp;
Like Chabert, the more famous Salamander of 1826, <a
name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a> this man entered a burning furnace with
apparent unconcern, and (as he informed an inquisitive spectator)
&lsquo;titt as fell as he cott,&rsquo; though the performance
made him very &lsquo;dursty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In contrast to these popular shows, the manager on Friday,
July 9, 1858, gave an &lsquo;Aristocratic F&ecirc;te,&rsquo;
arranged by a committee of gentlemen assisted by lady
patronesses, who are said to have been very chary of issuing
tickets to other ladies whom the gentlemen proposed to
invite.&nbsp; But the invitations mattered little, for the 9th
turned out to be one of the wettest days of an English July, and
the aristocratic ambitions of Cremorne were damped down for ever.
<a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In the
balloon ascents of Cremorne (as already remarked) there was often
a dangerous element, usually a parachute descent.&nbsp; Without
dwelling on the ascents of balloonists like Lieutenant Gale and
the celebrated Charles Green, who made his three hundredth and
sixty-fifth voyage (of course including his ascents at Vauxhall
and many other places) on August 2, 1847, we can notice only the
Bouthellier, Poitevin, and Latour performances.</p>
<p>In August, 1852, <a name="citation9a"></a><a
href="#footnote9a" class="citation">[9a]</a> a French aeronaut
named Bouthellier ascended on a trapeze attached to the car of a
balloon, and when the balloon was at a respectable height began
to twist himself round &lsquo;almost in a knot,&rsquo; then to
untie himself, and finally to suspend his body as he hung, first
by his neck, then by his heels.&nbsp; The reporter tells us that
this was done &lsquo;to the evident mingled alarm and pleasure of
the spectators,&rsquo; and the whole thing was considered to
&lsquo;redound greatly to the credit&rsquo; of Mr. Simpson.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In September of the same year (1852), Madame Poitevin,
&lsquo;in the character of Europa,&rsquo; ascended from Cremorne
on the back of a heifer which was attached to her balloon.&nbsp;
This was nothing new to <i>her</i> or to the sight-seers of
Paris, where she and her husband had made hundreds of ascents on
the backs of horses, and even &lsquo;a great many ascents with a
bull.&rsquo;&nbsp; A pony ascent had been made by Green at
Vauxhall in 1850, <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> but the English magistrates drew the
line at a heifer, and Simpson and his Europa were fined at the
Ilford Sessions on September 7, 1852, for cruelty to animals.</p>
<p>This wretched exhibition was not, of course, repeated, but
risky parachute feats were by no means to be abandoned.&nbsp; On
June 27, 1854, at about seven o&rsquo;clock, Henri Latour, a
balloonist of the age of fifty, went up lashed to a parachute
which was formed like a horse, and suspended from W. H.
Adams&rsquo;s balloon.&nbsp; As the balloon was rising an attempt
was made (by means of a trigger-iron) to release the parachute,
but it somehow got twisted, and its two guiding <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&lsquo;wings&rsquo; did not expand.&nbsp; The descent of
the balloon continued, and in the Tottenham marshes, which it had
now rapidly reached, struck the earth, and the unhappy Latour was
dragged over the ground and through the trees, and died a few
days after of his injuries. <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a></p>
<p>The programme of the theatre and the concert-room was less
exciting.&nbsp; The Cremorne theatricals never aimed much higher
than the farce and the vaudeville, but there were some good
ballets, in which (<i>circa</i> 1847&ndash;1851) the Deulins took
part.&nbsp; Under Simpson some of the old favourite comic singers
were engaged&mdash;Sam Cowell in 1846, Robert Glindon in 1847 and
1850. <a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a>&nbsp; Herr Von Joel, who appeared in
1848, was &lsquo;a peculiar old German&rsquo; <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a> who had made a sensation&mdash;which
became a bore&mdash;at Vauxhall Gardens.&nbsp; His business was
to appear at unexpected moments and in unsuspected parts of the
gardens, to yodel.&nbsp; Swiss ditties, and to give imitations,
on his walking-stick, of birds and feathered fowl.&nbsp; In his
later days he was a familiar figure at Evans&rsquo;s
Supper-Rooms, where he used to retail dubious cigars, and dispose
of tickets for benefits which never came off.&nbsp; J. W. Sharp
(&lsquo;Jack Sharp&rsquo;), who sang at Cremorne in 1850, was at
one time the rage of the town, and his comic songs were in demand
at Vauxhall and at such places as Evans&rsquo;s and the Mogul in
Drury Lane.&nbsp; But he took to dissipated ways, lost his
engagements, and died in the Dover Workhouse at the age of
thirty-eight. <a name="citation10d"></a><a href="#footnote10d"
class="citation">[10d]</a></p>
<p>Simpson&rsquo;s varied enterprises resulted in a substantial
profit, even if he did not make (as he told the impecunious Baron
Nicholson) the sum of &pound;100,000 during his first years at
Cremorne.&nbsp; His patrons were people of all ranks, and of
varying degrees of virtue.&nbsp; But Cremorne was never able <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to parade in
the newspapers that array of fashionable and distinguished
personages who &lsquo;last night&rsquo; visited Vauxhall.&nbsp;
It was not, for one thing, a place that ladies (in the strict
sense of the word) were in the habit of visiting, unless, perhaps
(as Mr. Sala puts it) &lsquo;in disguise and on the sly,&rsquo;
or, at any rate, under the safe conduct of a husband or
brother.&nbsp; Ladies of some sort were, no doubt, considerably
in evidence there, though we are not to think of Cremorne as so
entirely given over to &lsquo;drink, dancing, and devilry&rsquo;
as its sterner critics declared.&nbsp; If it was a place for the
man about town, it also attracted a number of worthy citizens and
country cousins who went there for an evening&rsquo;s pleasure
with their wives and daughters, and were &lsquo;not
particular.&rsquo;&nbsp; A livelier element was imported by the
medical students&mdash;a high-spirited race made responsible in
those days for the sins of many non-medical youngsters&mdash;by
Oxonians and Cantabs, by temporarily irresponsible clerks and
shopmen, and &lsquo;flash&rsquo; personages of various kinds.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In 1857 the Chelsea Vestry had presented the first of many
annual petitions against the renewal of the licence, setting
forth the inconvenience of the late hours of Cremorne, the
immoral character of its female frequenters, and its detrimental
influence generally on the morals (and house property) of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Such petitions, like the annual protests
against old Bartholomew Fair, were a long time in taking effect,
but, as Cremorne grew older, the rowdy and wanton element
certainly increased, and finally, as we shall see, not
undeservedly brought about its downfall.&nbsp; In spite of all
this, we know of more than one respected paterfamilias who has
still somewhere a Cremorne programme or two, the relic of some
pleasant and doubtless romantic evening in the sixties or
seventies, when he imagined himself to be seeing
something&mdash;if not too much&mdash;of &lsquo;real life&rsquo;
in London.&nbsp; In the sixties some charming little folding
programmes were issued, printed in colour, and presenting on
every page a view of Cremorne.&nbsp; Portions of the programme
were ingeniously cut out, so that on the front page there was <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>a view up the
long walk, flanked by its trees and lamp-bearing goddesses, right
to the great fountain.&nbsp; Another page depicted the
supper-table spread with its choice viands and &lsquo;rarest
vintages,&rsquo; and on another was a view of the circus, the
supper-boxes, and the promenade enlivened by a peripatetic
band&mdash;all for a shilling admission, and the patron, Her
Majesty the Queen. <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<p>Time has cast a veil over the orgiastic features of Cremorne,
and though this is just as well, some of its old frequenters may
cherish the feeling that there are no &lsquo;intrepid
aeronauts&rsquo; now, no fireworks like Duffell&rsquo;s, no
gaily-lighted tiers of supper-boxes, and no waltzing on circular
platforms with beauteous, if little known, damsels.</p>
<p>Simpson retired in 1861, <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a> and on July 30
there was a new manager, Edward Tyrrell Smith. <a
name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a>&nbsp; He has been denied, somehow, a
place in the great <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, but
one cannot turn over a programme of London amusements in the
fifties or sixties without encountering the name of E. T.
Smith&mdash;an interesting man, of boundless energy and resource,
and a lucky, if wayward, speculator, who was everything by turns
and nothing long.&nbsp; He was the son of Admiral E. T. Smith,
but his aspirations were not lofty, for he began life&mdash;he
was born in 1804&mdash;as a Robin Redbreast, one of the old
red-waistcoated Bow Street runners.&nbsp; When the new police
force was established Smith was too young for superannuation, so
he was made an inspector.&nbsp; But he soon tired of this, and
after trying his hand as a sheriff&rsquo;s bailiff or auctioneer,
went into the wine trade.&nbsp; In 1850 we find him landlord of a
tavern in Red Lion Street, Holborn, attracting custom by dressing
his <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>barmaids in bloomer costume.&nbsp; From about this date
his speculative genius turned to the management of London
theatres.&nbsp; He took the Marylebone, then Drury Lane, where he
made quite a lengthy stay, and even plunged into opera at Her
Majesty&rsquo;s.&nbsp; One of his eccentricities was to present
silver snuff-boxes and watches to his master-carpenters and
property-men, each presentation taking place on the stage,
accompanied by an appropriate speech.&nbsp; He was lessee of the
Lyceum, of the Surrey, of Astley&rsquo;s (when Ada Menken
appeared as Mazeppa), and he took Highbury Barn for one
season.&nbsp; He also founded the Alhambra in Leicester Square,
making short work, for his purpose, of its instructive
predecessor, the Panopticon.</p>
<p>He effected another transformation by turning
Crockford&rsquo;s gaming-house into the Wellington Restaurant,
and opened a second restaurant&mdash;but this was a dismal
failure&mdash;in the vaults of the Royal Exchange.&nbsp; He
further made a handsome profit out of a French bonnet-shop which
he established at Brighton, under the alluring name of
Cl&eacute;mentine.&nbsp; He financed Baron Nicholson at the Coal
Hole, became proprietor of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, and finally
settled down in the metal trade.&nbsp; If Smith had little money
of his own, he had a marvellous talent for extracting it from
others, for, with some managerial humbug in his doings, he was a
good-natured man, with plenty of friends who believed in his
speculative <i>flair</i>.&nbsp; One of his early devices was
ingenious.&nbsp; He hired from a money-lender at the rate of
&pound;1 a day a &pound;1,000 banknote, which he always carried
in his pocket&mdash;not to spend, but to deposit when he made a
purchase, and to inspire confidence generally.&nbsp; He retired
from Cremorne in 1869, and managed just to outlive the gardens,
for he died in 1877, on November 26.</p>
<p>Smith began his enterprise with a startling novelty&mdash;a
&lsquo;female Blondin&rsquo; who undertook to cross the
Thames.&nbsp; Late on an August afternoon of 1861 thousands of
spectators thronged the river banks and the esplanade of
Cremorne, or waited in small boats to see this new heroine of <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Niagara.&nbsp; A tight rope was stretched across the
river at a height varying from 50 to 100 feet, and at last the
female Blondin appeared.&nbsp; She was a delicate-looking little
woman, who called herself Madame Genvieve.&nbsp; Her real name
was Selina Young, and she was the granddaughter of James Bishop
the showman.&nbsp; One has seen the male Blondin making a careful
inspection of his guy-lines and supports before starting on his
perilous course.&nbsp; His female imitator began her progress at
once.&nbsp; When she had traversed about two-thirds of the
distance, she paused to rest on the narrow timber ledge of one of
the main supports of the rope.&nbsp; The rest was a long one, and
it was soon felt that something was wrong when the attendants
were seen tightening the remaining 600 or 700 feet of rope.&nbsp;
At last, after this trying pause&mdash;she had started
three-quarters of an hour earlier, and it was now growing dusk
and chilly&mdash;she moved a few feet forward; then she halted,
and then moved again.&nbsp; But the rope was now swaying like a
garden swing, for the guy-lines had been cut&mdash;apparently by
some scoundrel who wanted the leaden weights.&nbsp; Attempts were
being made to throw cords over the rope, when suddenly she let go
her balance-pole.&nbsp; It was a terrible moment, but with
infinite pluck and presence of mind the female Blondin caught the
rope with both hands, then a couple of weights suspended from it,
and next the cords by which that part of the rope was
steadied.&nbsp; Descending by the grasp of a three-quarter-inch
cord, she reached a boat, and was saved. <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a>&nbsp; But the warning was disregarded,
and the very next year the female Blondin was performing at
Highbury Barn.&nbsp; Here she fell from a rope which was damp and
slippery, and was made a cripple for life. <a

<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Another
sensation, though void of peril, of Smith&rsquo;s management was
the Cremorne tournament, which began on Wednesday, July 8, 1863,
<a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> and lasted two or three days.&nbsp; It
was suggested by the famous Eglinton tournament of August, 1839,
which is said to have cost the Earl of Eglinton
&pound;80,000.&nbsp; The Cremorne imitation was held, not in the
park or tilt-yard of a castle, but in the large pavilion of the
Ashburnham grounds, which was gay with flags and garlands and the
escutcheons of medieval heroes.&nbsp; The velvet and the gold
lace may have been less costly, but the effect was equally
impressive.&nbsp; At Eglinton Castle the Queen of Beauty was the
lovely Lady Seymour; the Marquis of Waterford was one of the
knights, and Prince Louis Napoleon one of the squires.&nbsp; The
knights and squires of Cremorne came chiefly from the theatre and
the circus, and the pages were ladies described by a journalist
as &lsquo;no strangers to the choreographic stage.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Queen of Beauty was Madame Caroline, a circus-rider well
known at Vauxhall and elsewhere, who is believed to have resided
in the New Cut.</p>
<p>The Scottish tournament was a fiasco, and was carried out
under the cover of umbrellas and great-coats in the intervals of
drenching rain which lasted for three days.&nbsp; The opening day
at Cremorne was bright and sunny, and the procession of 300 made
its entrance in imposing style: heralds in their gaudy tabards,
yeomen in Lincoln green, men-at-arms in glittering armour&mdash;a
whole <i>Ivanhoe</i> in motion.&nbsp; The tournament King, the
Queen of Beauty, and their suite, were escorted to a tapestried
tribune, and their gorgeous array contrasted strangely with the
tall-hatted and coal-scuttle-bonneted spectators who occupied the
seats on every side.&nbsp; The heralds made the proclamation, and
the jousting began.&nbsp; First, there were trials of skill
between knights of different countries all in armour, and mounted
on chargers with emblazoned housings.&nbsp; Some sports, like
tilting at the ring and the quintain, followed, and then came <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the grand
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e between the two companies of knights.&nbsp;
Finally, one of the combatants was unhorsed&mdash;<i>pro
forma</i>&mdash;and his antagonist received the prize of valour
from the Queen of Beauty.</p>
<p>Bands of music and facetious clowns, or rather
&lsquo;jesters,&rsquo; enlivened the proceedings, which were at
first exciting and a fine spectacle, though they tended to grow
monotonous. <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a></p>
<p>Among the minor entertainments of Smith&rsquo;s management was
the exhibition, in 1867, of Natator, the man-frog.&nbsp; This
human frog was a young man of twenty, who was to be seen through
the plate-glass front of a huge tank filled with 6 feet of
water.&nbsp; He imitated the motions of fish, stood on his head,
ate a sponge-cake, or smoked a pipe.&nbsp; A more rational
exhibition was the appearance of the Beckwith family in 1869. <a
name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a></p>
<p>In his last year (1869) Smith exhibited the French
&lsquo;captive balloon&rsquo; in the Ashburnham grounds.&nbsp;
This balloon was made of linen and indiarubber, and held thirty
people.&nbsp; It was attached by a strong rope worked by an
engine of 200 horse-power, and could be let out, so as to soar
&lsquo;in an aerial voyage over London,&rsquo; 2,000 feet.&nbsp;
The charge for an ascent was ten shillings, but a free admission
was granted to a female inmate of the Fulham Workhouse, who chose
to celebrate her hundredth birthday by a trip in the balloon,
attended by the matron.&nbsp; It was fortunately not on this
occasion that the captive balloon, after the manner of its kind,
escaped! <a name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"

<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>John
Baum, who became lessee in 1870, had not the character of his
predecessors, nor a hand strong enough to restrain the vagaries
of his more troublesome clients.&nbsp; But he was by no means
incapable as an entertainment manager and when the gardens were
opened they were found to be much improved, and a new theatre was
built.&nbsp; He developed the stage amusements, and produced some
good ballets, such as <i>Giselle</i>, in 1870.&nbsp; In 1875
there was a comic ballet by the Lauri family, and
Offenbach&rsquo;s <i>Rose of Auvergne</i>, with a ballet of 100,
was given.&nbsp; Auber&rsquo;s <i>Fra Diavolo</i> was presented
before a Bank Holiday audience in 1877. <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; The orchestra was a capable one
under Jules Riviere.&nbsp; In 1872 the licence for dancing, the
great attraction of Cremorne, was refused, but in 1874 the
waltzing or, the &lsquo;crystal platform&rsquo; was again as
lively as ever.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The one great, but melancholy, sensation of Baum&rsquo;s
management was the episode of &lsquo;Monsieur de Groof, the
flying man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Vincent de Groof was a Belgian who had
constructed a flying machine on which he made some ascents with
doubtful success in his native land.&nbsp; He came to England in
1874, and with some difficulty persuaded Baum to let him go
through his dangerous performance at Cremorne.&nbsp; Certainly
the flying man made a good advertisement, and on the evening of
June 29, 1874, there was a great concourse in the gardens.&nbsp;
The machine was suspended by a rope, 30 feet long, from the car
of Simmons&rsquo;s <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&lsquo;Czar&rsquo; balloon, and while the tedious
process of inflation was going on the spectators had time to
inspect a flying apparatus strange and wonderful.&nbsp; It was
constructed of cane and waterproof silk, and was made &lsquo;in
imitation of the bat&rsquo;s wing and peacock&rsquo;s
tail.&rsquo;&nbsp; Evidently De Groof, like his inventive
predecessor in <i>Rasselas</i>, had considered the structure of
all volant animals, and found &lsquo;the folding continuity of
the bat&rsquo;s wing most easily accommodated to the human
form.&rsquo;&nbsp; His wings were 37 feet long from tip to tip,
and his tail 18 feet long.&nbsp; In the centre was fixed an
upright wooden stand about 12 feet high, in which De Groof placed
himself, working the wings and tail by means of three
levers.&nbsp; He ascended from Cremorne about eight, and as the
balloon rose seemed like a big bird perched in his net
framework.&nbsp; He was meant to descend in the gardens, but the
wind carried the balloon away to Brandon in Essex, where he made
a perilous descent from the balloon, almost unseen, but
apparently without injury.&nbsp; The Cremorne habitu&eacute; felt
that he was cheated of a sight, and on July 9 the experiment had
to be repeated.&nbsp; At about half-past seven the machine was
once more taken up by Simmons&rsquo;s balloon, and this time
there was no changing of the venue.&nbsp; The balloon soared to a
great height, but for fully half an hour continued to hover over
the gardens.&nbsp; Then the wind bore it rapidly away in the
direction of St. Luke&rsquo;s Church, Chelsea, till the machine
was perilously near the church tower.&nbsp; No one quite knew
what happened at this moment.&nbsp; Simmons seems to have called
out, &lsquo;I must cut you loose,&rsquo; and De Groof to have
responded &lsquo;Yes, and I can fall in the
churchyard.&rsquo;&nbsp; Suddenly the rope was severed, the
machine, without resistance to the air, was seen to collapse, and
wind round and round in its descent, till it fell with a heavy
thud near the kerbstone in Robert Street. <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; A great crowd had collected, and
De Groof was picked up in a terrible state, and taken into the
Chelsea Infirmary to die.&nbsp; The fate of the balloon was an
anti-climax: it was carried away to Springfield <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>in Essex,
where it came down on the Great Eastern railway-line after a
narrow escape from a passing train.&nbsp; The whole affair caused
great excitement in London, and the details were copied into
papers like the <i>Indian Mirror</i>.&nbsp; A sheet-ballad sold
in the Chelsea streets drew the obvious morals, and appealed to
the tender-hearted passer-by:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You feeling hearts, list to my story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a most heartrending tale;<br />
And when the facts are laid before you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To drop a tear you cannot fail.&rsquo; <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we are nearing the last days of Cremorne.&nbsp; At no
period could the gardens be described as a place of quiet family
resort, and under Smith in the sixties we begin to hear of rows
and cases in the police courts.&nbsp; In 1863, for instance,
there was a &lsquo;riot&rsquo; on the night of the Oaks day, and
a number of men, apparently of decent position, stormed and
wrecked one of the bars.&nbsp; Six of them were caught, and fined
from &pound;20 to &pound;50 apiece.&nbsp; A scene of this kind
was partly the fault of the manager, who had advertised his
gardens as just the pleasure resort for a gentleman returning
from the races.&nbsp; One (undated) story of a Cremorne fracas,
told by G. A. Sala, is rather amusing, and worth repeating nearly
in his words.&nbsp; &lsquo;A gallant Captain and M.P.,&rsquo; who
was engaged to a young lady of good position, began to repent of
his promise.&nbsp; To get out of it honourably he could devise no
better plan than to disgrace himself at Cremorne.&nbsp; One
night, accordingly, he repaired to the gardens &lsquo;with a few
chosen boon companions,&rsquo; who, like himself, imbibed freely
of the rare vintages in the supper-rooms.&nbsp; The moment came
when he was in a mood &lsquo;to break things,&rsquo; and his
first onslaught was on the glasses and decanters of a refreshment
counter.&nbsp; Then he charged the dancing platform, frightened
the dancers, and scattered the musicians &lsquo;like <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>blossoms
before a March blast.&rsquo;&nbsp; They tried to stop him, but he
put the waiters <i>hors de combat</i>, and for some time made
short work of the police.&nbsp; The next morning the gallant
Captain and M.P. found himself, at the police court, Westminster,
provided with a sentence of fourteen days.&nbsp; From his
dungeon-cell in Holloway he wrote an abject letter to his
impending father-in-law, deploring the degradation he had brought
on himself and his friends, and relinquishing for ever all claims
on the beloved daughter.&nbsp; Next day the governor of the
prison handed him a letter from the same father-in-law, which ran
as follows: &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Jim</span>,&mdash;Sorry to hear you have got yourself into such a
scrape.&nbsp; Never mind; boys will be boys!&nbsp; Katie and I
will call for you in an open carriage on Monday week, and the
marriage will take place on the following morning at St.
James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These things were relatively trifles, and it was really not
till the seventies&mdash;under Baum&mdash;that Cremorne became an
impossible place.&nbsp; The Westminster Police Court was now
hardly ever without its drunk or disorderly case from the
gardens.&nbsp; Even the normal evenings at Cremorne were fairly
fertile in incident, but a big crop followed the abnormal
evenings&mdash;the night of some great event, the Derby, the
Oaks, the return of the Prince from India, or&mdash;a new
institution&mdash;the Bank Holiday.&nbsp; At such times extra
late hours were always granted, and they were those occasions
when champagne is said to &lsquo;flow like water.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was half-past ten, half-past eleven, twelve, and still the
theatres and music-halls were sending down fresh visitors, and
the cabs came rattling down the King&rsquo;s high road.&nbsp; The
bars and boxes were so many hives of drinking mortals&mdash;men
who had lost and men who had won, and the drinking quickly led to
an almost indiscriminate pugnacity.&nbsp; The wretched waiters,
even, were assaulted, though the pugilist thought he amply atoned
by a money payment &lsquo;on the spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The efforts of the half-hearted Chelsea Vestry of 1857 were
renewed with more vigour (and with more justification) from 1870
onwards, and they had a valuable ally in Canon <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Cromwell, the
principal of St. Mark&rsquo;s Training College, which stood
almost opposite the entrance of Cremorne.&nbsp; One of the many
unedifying illustrated papers of the seventies, the
<i>Day&rsquo;s Doings</i>, portrays the Canon in cap and gown
ejecting two flashily dressed females from the gardens, and he
and his docile students for the next six years are said to have
given Mr. Baum a very rough time.&nbsp; This opposition was not
popular, and on one 5th of November the worthy Canon was paraded
on a coster&rsquo;s barrow in front of Cremorne as a guy.&nbsp;
The comic papers sneered at the petitions &lsquo;signed by all
the babies and children under ten,&rsquo; and issued a revised
set of Cremorne Regulations.&nbsp; All ladies were henceforward
to have certificates of respectability from the Board of
Guardians, though members of the London School Board were to be
admitted free.&nbsp; No fireworks, dancing, smoking, laughing, or
flirting were allowed, but by an order from the Vestry you could
obtain a coffee cobler or a cocoa cocktail.&nbsp; Ridicule is
sometimes a legitimate weapon against the Puritan, but in this
case Canon Cromwell and the Vestry were hardly in the wrong.</p>
<p>The end came rather suddenly and in a curious way.&nbsp;
Towards the close of 1876 there was distributed in Chelsea a
pamphlet in verse, entitled <i>The Trial of John Fox</i>, <i>or
Fox John</i>, <i>or the Horrors of Cremorne</i>.&nbsp; It was
signed &lsquo;A. B. Chelsea,&rsquo; but the author was soon
discovered to be a Mr. Alfred Brandon, a worthy and evidently
courageous man, who had long been known as minister of the
Chelsea Baptist Chapel.&nbsp; By trade Mr. Brandon was a tailor,
and no doubt his coats were better than his poetry, which is,
indeed, sad doggerel.&nbsp; This pamphlet was an indictment of
Cremorne as the &lsquo;nursery of every kind of vice,&rsquo; and
of its callous money-grubbing manager John Fox.&nbsp; The jury
decide <i>against</i> John Fox:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Our verdict this: the Fox has had his
day.<br />
Destroy his covert&mdash;let him run away.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Baum is said to have been &lsquo;stung by these cutting
remarks&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;remarks&rsquo; which, whether they
stung or cut, <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>constituted, from the legal point of view, a highly
defamatory libel.&nbsp; He doubtless went unwillingly into court,
but in May, 1877, the libel action of Baum <i>v.</i> Brandon was
heard in the Queen&rsquo;s Bench before Sir Henry Hawkins.&nbsp;
Brandon pleaded, in the familiar way, first, that he had intended
no allusion to Baum, and, secondly, that he <i>had</i> alluded to
Baum, but that what he said was true, and, moreover, not
malicious.&nbsp; In court it was averred by Baum that Cremorne
was most respectably conducted, and that the houses in the
neighbourhood were most respectable.&nbsp; Brandon, to justify
the libel, called various witnesses, among whom were a Cremorne
waiter and a woman from a reformatory, who both traced their
downfall to the gardens.&nbsp; The jury found for Baum, but
awarded him a farthing damages, and each side had to pay its own
costs.</p>
<p>At this time Baum was greatly in debt, and for the next few
months was too ill to superintend his gardens personally.&nbsp;
None the less preparations were made for the licensing day in
October.&nbsp; Petitions were prepared, and counsel on both sides
were engaged.&nbsp; October 5, 1877, arrived, and the Cremorne
case was called on.&nbsp; To the astonishment of London,
Baum&rsquo;s counsel quietly announced that the lessee had
withdrawn his application, and the licence of Cremorne Gardens
lapsed for ever.</p>
<p>John Baum here vanishes from the scene, though we seem to
catch a glimpse of him at the end of the eighties as a waiter at
a North London tavern, discoursing freely to sympathetic
customers on the great days when he owned Cremorne.</p>
<p>The owner of the land, Mrs. Simpson, lost no time in letting
it in building plots, and most of the present rows of small
houses made their appearance in the next year or two.&nbsp; As
early as 1880 Cremorne Gardens is described as &lsquo;already the
lawful prey of the Walfords and Cunninghams,&rsquo; and brought
within &lsquo;the range of practical antiquaries.&rsquo; <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; But the gardens had first to be
cleared, and the Cremorne <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>sale took place on April 8, 1878, and
the following days.&nbsp; The buyers and sightseers who attended
the auction found the place already in a neglected
state&mdash;the grass uncut, and the canvas coverings and
panoramic views rent and blown about by the winds of the last six
months.&nbsp; The sale began with the hotel and the effects of
the sitting-rooms on the first floor known as the Gem, the Pearl,
the Rose, and the Star.&nbsp; Then the public supper-room on the
ground-floor was taken in hand.&nbsp; There was a great stock of
wine and spirits&mdash;600 dozens&mdash;and a unique opportunity
for buying claret cheap.&nbsp; The grand ballroom with theatre
combined, the theatre royal, and the marionette theatre, were
next disposed of, and the circular dancing platform, about 360
feet in circumference, was sold in thirty-two sections, including
the pagoda orchestra.</p>

<p>The elms and poplars and all the growing timber were then
offered, besides numerous portable bay-trees in boxes and about
20,000 greenhouse plants.&nbsp; The statuary, over and above the
Cupids and Venuses and the &lsquo;females supporting
gas-burners,&rsquo; included some classic masterpieces like the
Laoc&ouml;on and the Dying Gladiator.&nbsp; With the disposal of
the large reflecting stars, &lsquo;the stalactite rustic,
enclosure of the Gypsey&rsquo;s Cave,&rsquo; and a couple of
balloons, Cremorne was completely stripped.</p>
<p>A walk round Cremorne at the present day is a little
depressing, though less so than a visit to the squalid sites of
Vauxhall and the Surrey Zoo.&nbsp; The western boundary of the
gardens is, approximately, the present Ashburnham Road (or
Uverdale Road, if we include the Ashburnham annexe of
Cremorne).&nbsp; The eastern boundary was Cremorne Lane, now
mainly represented by Dartrey Street.&nbsp; The southern limit is
the present Lots Road, and a public-house, the Cremorne Arms, is
close to the former Cremorne Pier and the river entrance.&nbsp;
The Thames front is now covered with wharves and tall
buildings.&nbsp; The north boundary is still the King&rsquo;s
Road, the entrance being where the southern continuation of Edith
Grove begins.&nbsp; Stadium Street, Ashburnham <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Road,
Cremorne Road, and the Cremorne Arms, recall the varying fortunes
of the place.</p>
<p>In spite of the builders, a small portion of the gardens has
always remained.&nbsp; Forming a pleasant fringe to the
King&rsquo;s Road is the nursery-ground of Messrs. Wimsett and
Son, which stretches from Ashburnham Road to the part of Edith
Grove which represents the old entrance of Cremorne, and a grotto
or bower surmounted by some of the plaster goddesses of Cremorne
is still to be seen there. <a name="citation24"></a><a

25</span>MANOR-HOUSE BATHS AND GARDENS, CHELSEA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the end of the thirties
there stood in the King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea, between the
present Radnor Street and Shawfield Street, a deserted mansion
known as the Manor-House.&nbsp; It was spacious, if not lofty,
and had apparently nothing to do with the two historical
manor-houses of Chelsea. <a name="citation25a"></a><a
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; For some
years it had been unoccupied; its windows were broken, its
railings rusty, and weeds luxuriated in its front-garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Behind the house there had once been a fine garden and
orchard, and groves of fruit-trees still bore mulberries, apples,
and pears, which were the natural prey of the Chelsea youth. <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; The mansion had some reputation
as a haunted house, and at nightfall unearthly sounds were heard
by passers-by, which possibly proceeded from the depredators of
the orchard.&nbsp; But one day in the autumn of 1837 some workmen
were observed on the premises, and it became difficult to get
access to the orchard.</p>
<p>The old Manor-House was, in truth, in process of
transformation.&nbsp; A certain Mr. Richard Smith, described as
&lsquo;a pleasant, portly gentleman,&rsquo; and said to have made
money by an official connexion with Crockford&rsquo;s Club, had
taken the place in hand.&nbsp; The suburbs&mdash;or, at least,
the suburb <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>of Chelsea&mdash;were destitute of public baths, and Mr.
Smith proposed to supply the want by erecting on the site of the
house, or near it, a capacious building.&nbsp; His baths were
opened in 1838, and the popular orchard was utilized as a garden
promenade, which he provided with an orchestra and a room for
concerts and dancing.&nbsp; In imitation of the panoramas of the
Surrey Zoological Gardens, the &lsquo;Taking of Fort
Bhurtpore&rsquo; was reproduced in the grounds, and the fireworks
and crackers of Professor Tumour rendered the capture of the
fortress by the English a lifelike spectacle.</p>

<p>The place was a good deal advertised in 1838 and 1839, and
well puffed in papers like <i>The Town</i>; but it was not a
success.&nbsp; A frank critic, who was well acquainted with the
&lsquo;New Vauxhall,&rsquo; as the proprietor named it, says that
the company &lsquo;consisted chiefly of local sweethearts,&rsquo;
who preferred to treat each other to apples and pears snatched
from the branches rather than expend superfluous cash in shilling
goblets of hot negus.&nbsp; The concerts took place on three
evenings in the week, and some &lsquo;grand galas&rsquo; and
&lsquo;night f&ecirc;tes&rsquo; were announced.&nbsp; On certain
days the boys from the Military School close by promenaded the
grounds with their band; but neither the concerts nor the baths
were acceptable, and in 1840 Smith discontinued the concerts, and
built a small theatre on part of the orchard.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Royal Manor-House Theatre&rsquo; could hold an audience of 500
paying 2s. and 1s.&nbsp; The Green Room was the emptied tank of
the swimming-bath.&nbsp; The first lessee was Charles Poole,
previously manager of the Chichester Theatre, and the plays light
one-act pieces.&nbsp; Poole soon got into money difficulties, and
Smith made a curious application to Edward Leman Blanchard, the
well-known dramatic critic, for his assistance.&nbsp; Blanchard
was then hardly twenty, but he managed to keep the theatre open
for nearly a year.&nbsp; The company had not been quite
disbanded, and contained good material.&nbsp; Thus, Mr. A. Sidney
(afterwards the well-known actor Alfred Wigan) was ready to sing

posturer and man-monkey, and Richard Flexmore (later the famous

family formed a troupe of four supernumeraries.&nbsp; Blanchard

30</span>BATTY&rsquo;S HIPPODROME AND SOYER&rsquo;S SYMPOSIUM,
KENSINGTON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Great Exhibition of 1851 was
indirectly responsible for the existence in Kensington of two
short-lived institutions&mdash;a circus and a restaurant.&nbsp;
They are rather outside our subject, but, as having something of
an open-air character, may be briefly described.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1850 William Batty, a famous circus
proprietor, acquired some land within five minutes&rsquo; walk of
the new world-wonder, the &lsquo;Crystal Palace,&rsquo; and
erected thereon an elliptical-roofed pavilion which accommodated
many thousands of spectators, and had a large arena open to the
sky.</p>
<p>The Royal Hippodrome was opened in May, 1851, with a French
troupe brought over from the Hippodrome at Paris.&nbsp; The
performances generally took place in the evening, and the lowest
price of admission was sixpence.&nbsp; Two brass bands of a
rather blatant character enlivened the proceedings.&nbsp;
Favourite features of the entertainment were a Roman chariot race
and a &lsquo;triumphal race of the Roman Consuls,&rsquo; who were
represented by the three brothers Debach, each guiding six
horses.&nbsp; Why Roman Consuls should race is not explained, and
probably did not matter.&nbsp; Another excitement of the evening
was the Barbary Race of twelve unmounted horses, who dashed
headlong to the goal with distended nostrils and eyes of
fire.&nbsp; Other attractions were balloon ascents <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a> and F. Debach&rsquo;s journey on the
Arienne Ball up and down a narrow inclined plank.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>The
Hippodrome closed with the Exhibition, and only lived for one
other season, in 1852.&nbsp; Subsequently, and in the sixties, it
was used as a riding-school.&nbsp; The site lay nearly opposite
the broad walk of Kensington Gardens, between part of Victoria
Road and Victoria Walk and the present Palace Gate.&nbsp; De Vere
Gardens mainly occupy the site.</p>
<p>[Newspapers: <i>John Bull</i>, September, 1850, p. 582;
<i>Theatrical Journal</i>, 1851; views of the Hippodrome in
<i>Illustrated London News</i> for 1851.]</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The founder of the restaurant, of which, it was hoped, the
Great Exhibition would make the fortune, was Alexis Soyer, the
former chef of the Reform Club, one of the best-known
cooks&mdash;though by no means the greatest&mdash;of the classic
ages of dining.&nbsp; Soyer was a man of inventive genius and
resource, but one who (as the author of the <i>Art of Dining</i>
dryly remarked) &lsquo;was more likely to earn immortality by his
soup-kitchen than by his soup.&rsquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>In the early part of 1851 he took Gore House, the famous home
of Lady Blessington at Kensington, and fantastic skill and showy
decoration soon made the old-fashioned stucco-fronted building
the wonder of a London as yet unfamiliar with palatial
restaurants.&nbsp; The newspapers and a prospectus printed on
satin paper with green-tinted edges announced the advent of
&lsquo;Soyer&rsquo;s Universal Symposium,&rsquo; a single ticket
for which was to cost a guinea, and a family ticket&mdash;your
family might consist of five&mdash;three guineas.&nbsp; Every
room in the house was provided with a seductive name: the
Blessington Temple of the Muses; the Salle des Noces de Danae;
the glittering Roscaille of Eternal Snow; the Bower of Ariadne;
and the Celestial Hall of Golden Lilies.</p>
<p>The Grand Staircase had its walls painted with a
&lsquo;Mac&eacute;doine <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of all Nations,&rsquo; a monstrous
medley of animals, politicians, and artists, the <i>chef
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of George Augustus Sala, who for a time
acted as Soyer&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<p>The Cabinet de Toilette &agrave; la Pompadour (Lady
Blessington&rsquo;s boudoir) led to the Danae saloon, which was
embossed in gold and silver with showers of &lsquo;tears&rsquo;
or &lsquo;gems.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bower of Ariadne was painted
with vines and Italian landscapes, and the Celestial Hall was in
the Chinese taste.</p>
<p>The garden&mdash;a delightful adjunct to a London
restaurant&mdash;contained some fine trees, walnut and mulberry
trees among them, which had been the pride of the good William
Wilberforce when he lived in Gore House, before the coming of the
gorgeous Countess.&nbsp; The meadow or &lsquo;park&rsquo; of the
domain&mdash;really a grazing-meadow hired from a Kensington
cow-keeper&mdash;was adroitly styled the Pr&eacute;
d&rsquo;Orsay, and here was erected the Encampment of All
Nations, which was the public dining-hall, 400 feet long,
&lsquo;with a monster tablecloth, 307 feet long, of British
manufacture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The garden, reached by flights of steps from the back of the
house, had natural beauties of its own&mdash;Lady
Blessington&rsquo;s great rose-tree and Wilberforce&rsquo;s
thick-foliaged trees, Soyer added fountains and statuary, a
grotto of Ondine, a little pavilion of many-hued stalactites with
a crystal roof, and a statue of Hebe dispensing ambrosial liquors
through the shafts of the temple.&nbsp; Here also stood the
Baronial Hall, a building (not unsuggestive of Rosherville) 100
feet long, with a stained-glass roof.&nbsp; It was hung with
pictures by Soyer&rsquo;s wife (Emma Jones), and with the more
interesting crayon portraits by Count d&rsquo;Orsay.&nbsp; The
American Bar and the Ethiopian Serenaders were perhaps more
suited to Cremorne.</p>
<p>The Symposium opened on May 1, 1851, and the Metropolitan
Sanitary Association and other festively inclined societies began
to banquet in its halls.&nbsp; The average attendance was 1,000 a
day, and the takings amounted to &pound;21,000; but none the less
the great chef was &pound;7,000 out of pocket, and the Symposium
closed suddenly and for ever on October <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>14,
1851.&nbsp; There had, in fact, been many complaints of bad
dinners and imperfect management.&nbsp; It is not easy&mdash;or
was not in those days&mdash;to provide simultaneously
sightseers&rsquo; luncheons and dinners for epicures.&nbsp; Even
at this remote period, and without aspiring to the Bower of
Ariadne, one is appalled at the idea of dining in an Encampment
of All Nations at a table 307 feet long.&nbsp; The roasting of a
bullock whole, which took place in the Pr&eacute; d&rsquo;Orsay
on May 31, no doubt brought many shillings to the treasury, but
was reminiscent of Battersea Fields or of a Frost Fair on the
Thames.</p>
<p>In February, 1852, the place was dismantled, and the Hall and
the Encampment were sold by auction.&nbsp; The Gore estate was
purchased the same year by the Commissioners of the Exhibition,
and the grounds in later years formed part of those of the Royal
Horticultural Society. <a name="citation33"></a><a

<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>THE
HIPPODROME, NOTTING HILL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a race-course of some two
and a half miles in circuit.&nbsp; In 1837 a Mr. John Whyte had
turned his attention to the slopes of Notting Hill, and to the
Portobello meadows west of Westbourne Grove, and prepared a
course, not for golf, but for horse-racing and steeple-chasing,
with the accompaniments of a training-ground and stables for
about eighty horses.</p>
<p>The Hippodrome was opened on June 3, 1837.&nbsp; The public
were admitted for a shilling, and those who could not enter the
carriage enclosure mounted a convenient hill from which a
splendid view of the racing&mdash;also of much adjacent
country&mdash;could be obtained.&nbsp; No gambling-booths or
drinking-booths were permitted, but iced champagne, or humbler
beverages were to be obtained on this eminence.&nbsp; Lord
Chesterfield and Count d&rsquo;Orsay were the first stewards, and
the Grand Duke of Russia, the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of
Brunswick, and many noble personages, condescended to visit this
London Epsom, to which gay marquees and &lsquo;splendid
equipages&rsquo; lent &eacute;clat on a race-day.</p>
<p>These races were held for four years, and were duly recorded
in <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>, with the usual details of horse,
owner, and jockey.&nbsp; Cups of fifty and a hundred guineas were
offered.&nbsp; The proceedings generally began at two, and on one
occasion lasted till nine.</p>
<p>One drawback to the selectness of the Hippodrome (and the
proprietor&rsquo;s profits) was a path across the enclosure
through which the public had a right-of-way.&nbsp; The footpath
people seem, as a rule, to have been orderly enough, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>but gipsies,
&lsquo;prigs,&rsquo; and hawkers did not neglect the opportunity
of mingling with the nobility and gentry.&nbsp; In March, 1838,
an attempt was made in Parliament to block this footpath by a
measure entitled the Notting Hill Enclosure Bill; but this
harmless title was speedily perceived to conceal an attempt to
legalize horse-racing in London.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strong public
feeling&rsquo; (particularly strong in Bayswater and Notting
Hill) was excited, and many reasons, wise and foolish, were urged
against the measure.&nbsp; One objection was that the young
ladies in the boarding-schools of Kensington would be unable to
take their usual walks abroad.&nbsp; On the other hand&mdash;so
different are points of view&mdash;a writer in the <i>Sporting
Magazine</i> declared that the Hippodrome was &lsquo;a necessary
of London life, of the absolute need of which we were not aware
until the possession of it taught us its permanent
value.&rsquo;&nbsp; A reading of the Bill passed the Commons
early in 1838 by a majority of 26, but by September the Notting
Hill Enclosure Bill had been quietly dropped.&nbsp; Next year the
proprietor enclosed his course so as to exclude the obnoxious
path, but at a considerable sacrifice of space.&nbsp; The last
race was run in June, 1841.&nbsp; The proprietor had lost
heavily, not so much, perhaps, through mismanagement as on
account of a fatal defect in the course, which had a strong clay
soil, and was so damp that it could only be used for training
horses during part of the year.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In 1845 a Mr. J. Connop, described as &lsquo;the lessee of the
Hippodrome,&rsquo; made his appearance in the Insolvent
Debtors&rsquo; Court.&nbsp; He owed a trifle of &pound;67,000,
though, of course, there were the usual assets of &pound;10,000,
if only the property &lsquo;be properly worked.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
potent name of Ladbroke appears in these proceedings as the
ground-landlord.</p>
<p>A good idea of the course can be gained from the accompanying
plan, published in 1841.&nbsp; It will be found that Ladbroke
Terrace and Norland Square roughly define its lower limits.&nbsp;
Ladbroke Grove, Lansdown Road, and Clarendon Road now cut through
it northwards.&nbsp; The &lsquo;hill for pedestrians&rsquo; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>is crowned by
St. John&rsquo;s Church (built 1845) in Lansdown Crescent and
Ladbroke Grove.</p>
<p>Part of the course was preserved as late as 1852 with some
rough turf and a few hedges, at which adventurous lady-riders
practised their horses.</p>

<h2><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>THE
ROYAL OAK, BAYSWATER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the twenties this was still a
rural inn, with sloping, red-tiled roof and dormer windows,
standing quite alone. <a name="citation37a"></a><a
href="#footnote37a" class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; A visitor
coming from Paddington Green passed to it by a quiet
field-path&mdash;the Bishop&rsquo;s Walk, now Bishop&rsquo;s
Road&mdash;through a region of pleasant pastures and hedgerow
elms.&nbsp; A weeping ash and the sign of the Boscobel Oak stood
on a green in front of the house, and there were benches for the
wayfarer and a tea-garden.</p>
<p>In 1837, with the advent of the Great Western Railway, all
these country surroundings began to disappear, and the fields
were soon cut up for roads.&nbsp; The house was now brought
forward so as to stand nearer the road, and the tea-gardens were
sold for building. <a name="citation37b"></a><a
href="#footnote37b" class="citation">[37b]</a>&nbsp; The present
Royal Oak public-house, standing more forward than its
predecessor, is 89, Bishop&rsquo;s Road and No. 1, Porchester
Road.</p>
<p>A Welsh landlord (apparently in the early twenties) named
Davies paid a &pound;50 rent, which he could not get back by
catering for his few local customers, chiefly nurserymen.&nbsp;
At the present day the property is said to have changed hands for
&pound;24,000.</p>

the Royal Oak in 1825.&nbsp; <i>Cf.</i> Rutton in <i>Home
Counties Magazine</i>, ii., p. 21.]</p>
<p>In the thirties and forties the Bayswater district was full of
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>small
tea-gardens, one of which, the Princess Royal, <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a> &lsquo;opposite Black Lion Lane, now
called Queen&rsquo;s Road,&rsquo; may be mentioned.&nbsp; It was
kept in the forties by James Bott, previously of the Archery
Tavern, Bayswater.&nbsp; Mr. Bott had a bowling-green and
tea-rooms, an elegant fish-pond well stocked with gold and silver
fish, and &lsquo;an extensive archery ground, 185 feet long, and
wide enough for two sets of targets.&rsquo;&nbsp; His
advertisements hold out two special attractions&mdash;one that
any gentleman fond of archery might practise there from nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning till two in the afternoon for ten
shillings a year; the other that the grounds led by the nearest
way to the Kensal Green Cemetery.</p>
<h2><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>CHALK
FARM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a favourite tea-garden
from the latter part of the eighteenth century till the
fifties.&nbsp; An inn, originally called the White House, had
long existed near the foot of Primrose Hill, and probably first
gained custom by its proximity to the hill, which (about 1797) is
described <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a> as a &lsquo;very fashionable&rsquo;
Sunday resort of the modern citizens, who usually &lsquo;lead
their children there to eat their cakes and partake of a little
country air&rsquo;&mdash;a truly idyllic performance.&nbsp; Chalk
Farm had also its more martial customers, for towards the close
of the eighteenth century the St. Pancras Volunteers used to
march thither to fire at a target at the foot of the hill for a
silver cup.&nbsp; The duels, moreover, for which a field
adjoining the inn was notorious began at least as early as 1790,
and lasted till the twenties.&nbsp; As they are hardly to be
reckoned among the amusements of the place, I need not record
their painful details.&nbsp; The famous interrupted duel of Tom
Moore and Francis Jeffrey&mdash;when &lsquo;Bow Street myrmidons
stood laughing by&rsquo;&mdash;occurred in 1806.&nbsp; Byron
treats it as ludicrous, but the meeting was not without its
pathos.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a beautiful morning it is!&rsquo; said
Jeffrey, on seeing his opponent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
answered Moore; &lsquo;a morning made for better
purposes.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which Jeffrey&rsquo;s only response was
&lsquo;a sort of assenting sigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another famous duel
took place on February 16, 1821, by moonlight, between John
Scott, the editor of the <i>London Magazine</i>, and Mr.
Christie.&nbsp; Scott was badly wounded, and was carried on a
shutter to the tavern, where he died in a <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>fortnight.&nbsp; This was practically the last of the
Chalk Farm duels, <a name="citation40a"></a><a
href="#footnote40a" class="citation">[40a]</a> and, curiously
enough, it is the <i>London Magazine</i> <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a> that about a year later furnishes a
long and most philosophical account of the tea-drinking at this
very garden.&nbsp; What the writer notices is the
<i>seriousness</i> of the ordinary frequenter of the garden, who
drinks and smokes with no approach to the least flexibility of
limb or feature.&nbsp; There are three plain citizens sitting
stolidly in one alcove without uttering a word.&nbsp; In another
box, over a glass of punch, are a prim tradesman and his wife and
a sickly-looking little boy, who wants to play with the other
children on the lawn, but who is not allowed to &lsquo;wenture
upon the nasty vet grass.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same observer also
notes the occasionally successful efforts of the Cockney
sportsmen to shoot wretched sparrows let out of a box at twenty
yards&rsquo; distance.</p>
<p>In the thirties the aspect was more cheerful, with pony-races,
rifle-shooting, <a name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c"
class="citation">[40c]</a> and the contests of the Cumberland and
Westmorland wrestlers for silver tankards and snuffboxes.</p>
<p>The tavern (the successor of an older building) was pulled
down in 1853, and the present public-house&mdash;No. 89,
Regent&rsquo;s Park Road&mdash;was built.&nbsp; The open fields
which formerly led from this site to the slopes of Primrose Hill
are now covered by houses at the back and front of the present
building, and the row of tall houses in Primrose Hill Road would
effectively shut out the view, even if the tavern had still
preserved its garden.&nbsp; A water-colour drawing of about 1830
shows Chalk Farm without any building intervening between itself
and its grassy mount.&nbsp; One side of the tavern is provided
with many windows, and a veranda looks towards the hill, and
close by is the flower-garden.&nbsp; At the back of the house are
fields and a road leading to the lower slopes.</p>

EEL-PIE (OR SLUICE) HOUSE, HIGHBURY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> tavern on the New River,
between Highbury and Hornsey Wood House, was well known to
Cockney visitors from early in the nineteenth century till its
demolition about 1867. <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a></p>
<p>It was famous for its tea and hot rolls, but still more for
its excellent pies made of eels, which were popularly supposed to
be natives of Hugh Myddelton&rsquo;s stream, though they came in
reality from the coast of Holland.&nbsp; Unambitious anglers of
the Sadler&rsquo;s Wells type frequented the river near here, and
on popular holidays in the twenties and thirties &lsquo;the lower
order of citizens&rsquo; (as an Islington historian politely
calls them) had breakfast at the Eel-Pie House on their way to
gather &lsquo;palms&rsquo; in Hornsey Wood or more distant
regions.&nbsp; The house had a pleasant garden till its latest
days, but little in the way of gala nights or ballooning.</p>
<p>In the strenuous era of prize-fighting even this quiet place
was not without its excitements.&nbsp; Thus, we read that on one
day in January, 1826, a wrestling-match was announced between Ned
Savage and another.&nbsp; Savage&rsquo;s opponent (Mr. Pigg) was
not forthcoming, and the &lsquo;fancy coves,&rsquo; not to be
disappointed, retired to a large room in the Sluice House, and
soon formed a temporary ring with the forms and <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>tables.&nbsp;
A dog-fight and a rat-killing match were then exhibited, and,
something &lsquo;of a more manly character&rsquo; being called
for, a purse was collected, and Bill Webb of Newport Market and
(an unnamed) Jack Tar were soon engaged.&nbsp; &lsquo;About
twenty rounds were fought; both men received heavy punishment,
and both showed fair game qualities.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
sailor&rsquo;s courage was particularly admired, but he, alas!
had to strike his colours, and Bill Webb &lsquo;pocketed the
blunt.&rsquo;</p>

44</span>WESTON&rsquo;S RETREAT, KENTISH TOWN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> garden in the present Highgate
Road had a brief existence <i>circa</i> 1858&ndash;1865, under
the management of Edward Weston, the proprietor of Weston&rsquo;s
(afterwards the Royal) Music Hall in Holborn.&nbsp; A good deal
was crowded into a small space, for besides the choice flowers,
shrubs, and fruit-trees, there was a conservatory, a cascade, a
racquet-court, a small dancing-platform and orchestra, and a
panorama 1,600 feet long, representing &lsquo;the sea-girt island
of Caprera, the home of the Italian Liberator&rsquo;
(Garibaldi).&nbsp; This encircled the garden, and was lit at
night by variegated gas-jets, stated&mdash;but the garden
illuminator always exaggerates&mdash;to be 100,000 in
number.&nbsp; The admission was usually only sixpence.</p>
<p>Some of the entertainers of the Polytechnic Institution were
engaged to combine instruction with amusement, and Mr. A.
Sylvester exhibited there his patent optical illusion
called&mdash;though hardly by Mr. Weston&rsquo;s
patrons&mdash;the Kalospinthechromokrene. <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a></p>
<p>There were complaints about the way in which this miniature
Cremorne was conducted, and the Sunday opening was particularly
objected to by its respectable neighbours.&nbsp; It appears to be
the unnamed &lsquo;Retreat&rsquo; which James Greenwood in one of
his books describes in scathing terms. <a

<a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> is a humble relic of the early days of
this place, which stood on the west side of the High Street.</p>
<p>The assembly-room, connected with the tavern by a covered way,
and the extensive grounds, were much frequented during the last
century till the forties.&nbsp; The grounds consisted of an upper
and lower bowling-green&mdash;one of them sometimes used for
archery&mdash;and an umbrageous &lsquo;dark walk&rsquo;
encompassing the kitchen-garden, which was on the west side of
the brook which divided the grounds.</p>
<p>Ballooning was for many years a feature of the place,
especially in the thirties. <a name="citation46b"></a><a
href="#footnote46b" class="citation">[46b]</a>&nbsp; In
September, 1837, Mrs. Graham tried an experiment with two
parachutes: one, a model of Garnerin&rsquo;s, was found to
oscillate greatly when released from the balloon; the other,
Cocking&rsquo;s parachute, descended slowly and steadily.&nbsp; A
month earlier (August 9, 1837) Mrs. Graham had delighted the
frequenters of the Mermaid Tea-Gardens by an ascent in the
&lsquo;Royal Victoria,&rsquo; accompanied by Mrs. W. H. Adams and
Miss Dean.&nbsp; A lithograph of the time shows these ladies,
&lsquo;the only three female aeronauts that ever ascended
alone,&rsquo; in their best dresses, cheerfully waving flags to
the people below.</p>
<p>An ascent made by Sadler in his &lsquo;G. P. W.&rsquo;
(George, Prince of Wales) balloon on August 12, 1811, caused
great local <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>excitement.&nbsp; Crowds poured in from Greenwich,
Deptford, and Woolwich, and the road became so blocked that even
&lsquo;families of distinction could not approach within a mile
of the tavern.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some fortunate parishioners ascended
the tower of the church, and a jolly tar got astride of the
Mermaid sign.&nbsp; In front of the house an abnormal assemblage
of fat men and still fatter women jostled and pushed and tumbled
one over another in a way that delighted the coarse caricaturists
of the period.&nbsp; Sadler&rsquo;s companion was a naval
officer, Lieutenant (or Captain) Paget, who paid a hundred
guineas for his seat in the car.&nbsp; As the balloon rose, Mr.
Paget was &lsquo;for some minutes deprived of the power of
expression and incapable of communicating his sensations&rsquo;
to his fellow-traveller, but he did all that was necessary by
keeping quiet and waving a flag to the spectators.&nbsp; An hour
and a quarter passed, and a descent was then made near Tilbury
Fort, and the travellers, who had started at a quarter to three,
returned to Hackney at a few minutes after nine. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>The old tavern was pulled down at the end of the thirties, and
several houses were built on its site.&nbsp; The assembly-room
and gardens continued in existence for many years later, but are
now also built over.</p>

<h2><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>THE
ROSEMARY BRANCH, HOXTON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the eighteenth century, in
the days when the London archers shot at rovers <a
name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> in the Finsbury fields, there stood
near Hoxton Bridge (at the meeting of the parishes of St.
Leonard, Shoreditch, and St. Mary, Islington) an &lsquo;honest
ale-house&rsquo; named the Rosemary Branch, <a
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> which was doubtless ofttimes visited
by the thirsty archer for a mug of beer and a game of
shovel-board.&nbsp; The place has no history for many years,
though in 1764 it emerges for a moment in a newspaper paragraph:
<a name="citation48c"></a><a href="#footnote48c"
class="citation">[48c]</a> &lsquo;On Sunday night [August 5],
about eight o&rsquo;clock, as a Butcher and another man were
fighting near the Rosemary Branch, the Butcher received an
unlucky blow on the side of his ribs, which killed him on the
spot.&nbsp; The cause of the quarrel was this: Some boys having a
skiff with which they were sailing in a pond near the aforesaid
place, the Butcher endeavouring to take it from them, a
well-dressed man that was passing expostulated with the man, and
putting the question to him, how he should like to be served so
if he was in the lads&rsquo; stead?&nbsp; On which the Butcher
struck the gentleman, who defended himself, and gave the deceased
a blow on the temple, and another under his heart, of which he
died.&nbsp; His body was carried to Islington Churchyard for the
Coroner to sit on it, and yesterday the said gentleman <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>was examined
before the sitting Justices at Hicks&rsquo;s Hall touching the
said affair, and admitted to bail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1783 the old inn was demolished, or was, at any rate,
absorbed in the premises of some white-lead manufacturers, who
erected (1786&ndash;1792) two mills&mdash;conspicuous as
<i>wind</i>mills&mdash;in the vicinity.&nbsp; A new tavern was
built in front of the mills, with small grounds&mdash;about three
acres&mdash;attached to it.&nbsp; The Rosemary Branch was now
frequented as a tea-garden, one of the attractions being
&lsquo;the pond near the aforesaid place,&rsquo; which was used
for boating and skating till, to the disgust of the Sunday
visitors, it suddenly dried up about the year 1830.</p>
<p>John Cavanagh, the fives player (died 1819), whose exploits
have been commemorated by William Hazlitt, sometimes found his
way to the Rosemary Branch, though most of his matches took place
in the neighbourhood at Copenhagen House.&nbsp; By trade he was a
house-painter, and one day, putting on his best clothes, he
strolled up to the gardens for an afternoon holiday.&nbsp; A
stranger proposed to Cavanagh a match at fives for half a crown
and a bottle of cider.&nbsp; The match began&mdash;7, 8, 10, 13,
14 all.&nbsp; Each game was hotly contested, but Cavanagh somehow
just managed to win.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never played better in my
life,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;and yet I can&rsquo;t win
a game.&nbsp; There, try that!&nbsp; That is a stroke that
Cavanagh could not take.&rsquo;&nbsp; Still the play went on, and
in the twelfth game the stranger was 13 to his opponent&rsquo;s
4.&nbsp; He seemed, in fact, to be winning, when a new-comer
among the bystanders exclaimed: &lsquo;What! are <i>you</i>
there, Cavanagh?&rsquo;&nbsp; The amateur fives player let the
ball drop from his hand, and refused to play another stroke, for
all this time he had only &lsquo;been breaking his heart to beat
Cavanagh.&rsquo; <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"

<p>Early in the thirties, the proprietor, a Mr. McPherson, began
to provide &lsquo;gala nights&rsquo; for the inhabitants of the
district, and advertised his &lsquo;Branch&rsquo; as the
Islington Vauxhall.&nbsp; In 1835 he is said to have spent
&pound;4,000 on the <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>place, but for some mysterious reason chose this moment
for retiring from business.&nbsp; In October, 1836, the gardens
were offered for sale&mdash;three acres only, but provided with
&lsquo;elevated terrace-walks&rsquo; screened by trees, and with
ground for rackets and skittles.&nbsp; The place was taken by a
new proprietor, who continued the fireworks and illuminations,
and introduced (1837) Mrs. Graham and her balloon, in which she
ascended with the gallant Colonel of the Honourable Lumber
Troop.</p>

<p>A view of about the middle of the forties depicts the gardens
as entirely surrounded by alcoves and trees, with two rope
ascents and a pony race <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a> going on in the
arena simultaneously, like Barnum&rsquo;s Circus.&nbsp; An
admiring youth, a lady in an ample shawl and hat, and two
gentlemen posed in the manner of tailors&rsquo; models, occupy
the foreground, while a crowd of onlookers stand in front of the
circle of boxes.&nbsp; Festoons of coloured lamps, a minute
balloon, a small theatre, and an orchestra, are also symbolic of
the attractions of the Islington Vauxhall.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Early
in the fifties the spirited proprietor (William Barton) was
advertising his ball-room and monster platform, and introduced
Moffatt&rsquo;s Equestrian Troupe and the Brothers Elliot, two
clever acrobats from Batty&rsquo;s Hippodrome. <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a>&nbsp; The Chinese Exhibition,
transplanted from Hyde Park, was expounded by a native
interpreter, &lsquo;whose pleasing description of the manners and
customs of these Eastern people was in itself highly instructive
and amusing.&rsquo;&nbsp; John Hampton, a noted balloonist of the
time, was also engaged for many ascents.</p>
<p>On July 27, 1853, the timber circus caught fire, and an
ill-fated troupe of trained dogs and seven horses perished.&nbsp;
I do not suggest that these seven horses constituted the whole of
the garden stud, but after this time we happen to hear little of
the Rosemary Branch as an open-air resort.&nbsp; It was always a
place for visitors of humble rank, the admission being sixpence
or a shilling.&nbsp; A ticket of 1853 notifies that persons not
&lsquo;suitably attired&rsquo; will be excluded.&nbsp; It was,
moreover, announced that the M.C.&rsquo;s (Messrs. Franconi and
Hughes) &lsquo;keep the strictest order,&rsquo; and a policeman
or two hovered in the background.&nbsp; All, therefore, should
have gone well.</p>
<p>The successor of the Rosemary Branch is a public-house, the
Rosemary Branch and Shepperton Distillery, No. 2, Shepperton
Road, N., lying between Rosemary Street and Brunswick
Place.&nbsp; Houses now occupy the space behind the
building.&nbsp; In the background the tall chimney of the
white-lead works (Messrs. Campion, Druce, No. 35, Southgate Road)

<h2><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>SIR
HUGH MYDDELTON&rsquo;S HEAD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a picturesque old inn,
built, it is said in 1614, standing by the water-side opposite
the New River Head and Sadler&rsquo;s Wells.&nbsp; It is shown in
Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Evening&rsquo; (1738)&mdash;a gable-ended,
vine-clad house with the portrait of the great Sir Hugh as its
pendent sign.&nbsp; It will be remembered that this picture
represents a portly dame, accompanied by an evidently ill-used
husband and two crying children, passing by the tavern, wherein a
merry drinking-party is seen through the open window.&nbsp;
Perhaps the mantling vine is not a natural feature of the place,
but bitter Hogarthian symbolism&mdash;&lsquo;Thy wife shall be as
the fruitful vine upon the walls of thy house.&rsquo;&nbsp; On
the other hand, Clerkenwell has still its Vine Yard Walk, and
twenty years ago in one or two of the gardens in a square near
Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, there might be found a vine which produced
a passable grape.</p>
<p>The banks of the New River at this time&mdash;and, indeed,
till near the middle of the nineteenth century&mdash;were lined
with tall poplars and graceful willows, and were frequented by
anglers, young and old.&nbsp; Hood, in his <i>Walton
Redivivus</i> (1826), describes Piscator fishing near the
Myddelton&rsquo;s Head without either basket or can, sitting
there (as Lamb expresses it) like Hope, day after day,
&lsquo;speculating on traditionary gudgeons.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
covering in of the New River in 1861&ndash;1862 ended the
Sadler&rsquo;s Wells angling for ever.</p>
<p>The house was the favourite haunt of the Sadler&rsquo;s Wells
company, and old Rosoman, the proprietor of the theatre; Maddox,
the wonderful man who balanced a straw while <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>dancing on
the wire; Harlequin Bologna, Dibdin, and Jo. Grimaldi, smoked
many a pipe in its long room or in an arbour in the garden.&nbsp;
In the fifties, a parlour denominated the &lsquo;Crib&rsquo; was
set apart for certain choice spirits, who, according to Mr. E. L.
Blanchard, were so uncommonly select that they demanded &lsquo;an
introduction and a fee&rsquo; from all newcomers.</p>
<p>The tavern, having fallen into decay, was replaced in 1831 by
a plain, ugly building, surmounted by a bust of Myddelton.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;grounds,&rsquo; chiefly from the twenties to the
fifties, formed a miniature tea-garden with &lsquo;boxes,&rsquo;
shrubs, and flowers.&nbsp; They were improved in 1852 by Deacon,
who succeeded Edward Wells as proprietor.&nbsp; The house, which
stood at the west end of Myddelton Place, close to Thomas Street
and opposite Arlington Street, was swept away for the formation
of Rosebery Avenue.</p>

<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>THE
PANARMONION GARDENS, KING&rsquo;S CROSS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> formation of the
pleasure-garden that we know as Earl&rsquo;s Court out of the
coal-yards of the North End Road has a parallel in the origin of
some ephemeral gardens which arose at Battle Bridge (King&rsquo;s
Cross) on or near the site of mountainous heaps of dust and
ashes.&nbsp; The place was recalled by the &lsquo;Literary
Dustman&rsquo; when he sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My dawning genus fust did peep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Near Battle Bridge, &rsquo;tis plain, sirs;<br />
You recollect the cinder-heap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vot stood in Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane, sirs.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, when these historic dust-heaps were carted off to
Russia&mdash;the story is a true one&mdash;and utilized in
rebuilding the walls of Moscow, they left a void which even the
London builder could not immediately fill.&nbsp; In the twenties
there was still a large vacant space near the corner of
Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane, bounded by (the present) Liverpool,
Manchester, and Argyle Streets, and reaching nearly to the Euston
Road.&nbsp; This space became the property of a company which, in
1829, invited the public by prospectus to subscribe about
&pound;20,000 for its development. <a name="citation54"></a><a
href="#footnote54" class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; The worthy
historian of Clerkenwell describes this company as the
&lsquo;Pandemomium&rsquo; (<i>sic</i>), but as a matter of fact
it called itself the Panarmonion, and had nothing demoniac in its
objects, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>but rather the laudable purpose of converting a dusty
wilderness into a garden and temple of the Muses.&nbsp; The
promoter was a certain Signor Gesualdo Lanza, who presided over a
school for acting and singing in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Lanza
proposed to establish&mdash;and displayed in lithographic
plans&mdash;a great &lsquo;Panarmonion Institution,&rsquo;
consisting of a theatre, a concert-hall, a
&lsquo;refectory,&rsquo; a reading-room, and even an hotel.&nbsp;
These buildings were to rise in a pleasaunce encircled by trees
and alcoves, and adorned with a great fountain and cascade.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In March, 1830, the place was opened, but the dreams of the
prospectus were never realized.&nbsp; A shilling was charged for
admission to the gardens, but it does not appear that they were
ever properly laid out, and the only attraction was a tour of the
grounds in a peculiar &lsquo;Suspension Railway,&rsquo; the
invention of Mr. H. Thorrington.&nbsp; This railway consisted of
a boat-shaped car suspended from a substantial level bar, along
which it travelled on small wheels set in motion by a wheel in
the car worked by hand. <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a>&nbsp; For the more
adventurous visitors, hobby-horses (rudimentary
&lsquo;cycles&rsquo;) were likewise suspended from the bar, and
worked in the same way as the boat.&nbsp; The theatre, of which a
noble elevation by &lsquo;Stephen Geary, architect,&rsquo; <a
name="citation55b"></a><a href="#footnote55b"
class="citation">[55b]</a> had been shown in the prospectus,
turned out to be a small and narrow building, originally erected
for an auction-room, which Lanza opened in March, 1830, with an
amateurish performance of the opera of <i>Artaxerxes</i>.&nbsp;
The enterprise was a failure from the first; the lease of the
theatre was <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>offered for sale in August, <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a> and we hear no more
of the gardens.</p>
<p>In May, 1832, Mrs. Fitzwilliam, of the Adelphi, and W. H.
Williams, the comic actor and singer, tried their hands, and
reopened the Panarmonion theatre as the &lsquo;Royal
Clarence,&rsquo; decorating it in the style of a Chinese
pavilion.&nbsp; It is claimed that many well-known actors learnt
their art at this bijou theatre.&nbsp; What is certain is that it
often changed its name&mdash;being called, for instance, the
Cabinet, and, in its latest days, the King&rsquo;s Cross
Theatre&mdash;and that both actors and audiences steadily
deteriorated.&nbsp; During the greater part of its existence its
boards were trodden by stage-struck amateurs; at one time it was
used as a tobacco manufactory; and in the eighties or nineties
its entrance-front might be seen plastered with bills announcing
a mission-service or a temperance meeting.&nbsp; At last, early
in 1897, Messrs. Reggiori, the proprietors of the neighbouring
restaurant (Nos. 1 and 3, Euston Road) took the little theatre
bodily into their premises, of which it now forms an additional
dining-saloon.&nbsp; The old entrance-front (in Liverpool Street)
has been smartened up with stucco and stained-glass windows.</p>
<p>It seems likely that the vanished gardens gave a hint for the
laying out of Argyle Square, which covers a considerable portion
of their site.</p>

EAGLE AND GRECIAN SALOON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Eagle tavern and Grecian
theatre which stood till lately at the corner of the dreary City
Road and Shepherdess Walk were developed out of a quiet
eighteenth-century pleasure-garden known as the Shepherd and
Shepherdess, which had its arbours, skittle-ground, and small
assembly-room. <a name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a>&nbsp; About 1822 a rather remarkable
man, named Thomas Rouse (born in 1784), came into possession of
the premises. <a name="citation57b"></a><a href="#footnote57b"
class="citation">[57b]</a>&nbsp; He is said to have begun life as
a bricklayer; at any rate, he had a turn for building, and in
later days indulged himself in saloons, pavilions, and Cockney
gardening.&nbsp; He rebuilt the tavern, or, at any rate, renamed
it the Eagle, and from 1824 onwards the Eagle lawn was the scene
of some of Green&rsquo;s balloon ascents, and of annual
tournaments of the Devon and Cornish wrestlers and single-stick
players.&nbsp; One of the earliest balloon ascents, on May 25,
1824, gave a melancholy advertisement to the place.&nbsp; A
balloonist named Thomas Harris ascended from the grounds,
accompanied by a young lady named Sophia Stocks, who was
described by the journalists as &lsquo;an intrepid girl&rsquo;
who entered the balloon &lsquo;with but slight <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>appearance of
fear.&rsquo;&nbsp; The balloon took the direction of Croydon, but
by its fall to the earth in Beddington Park, Harris was killed
and his companion severely injured. <a name="citation58a"></a><a
href="#footnote58a" class="citation">[58a]</a></p>
<p>The coronation of William IV. in 1831 did not pass without
influence on the Eagle, for in October the proprietor bought up
the fittings of the Abbey entrance and robing-rooms and erected
them as an entrance to his gardens, advertising them not only as
the identical fittings, but as re-erected by &lsquo;the identical
mechanics.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this year, also, the famous Grecian
Saloon came into existence.&nbsp; It was furnished with an organ
and &lsquo;a superb self-acting piano&rsquo;; also with a superb
gas chandelier, and with classic paintings by Philip Phillips, a
pupil of Clarkson Stanfield and &lsquo;scene-painter to the
Adelphi and Haymarket.&rsquo; <a name="citation58b"></a><a
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a></p>
<p>The Eagle reopened in the spring of 1832 with many of the
attractions that long continued to characterize it.&nbsp; In the
garden was an orchestra of Oriental type, variously described as
Moorish or Chinese, and the Pandean Band from Vauxhall Gardens
was engaged to perform.&nbsp; Dancing took place, generally once
a week, in the &lsquo;Grecian tent&rsquo; or in the
assembly-room, and the gardens were adorned with Chinese
lanterns, cosmoramas, fountains, and dripping rocks.&nbsp; In the
Saloon there were concerts and &lsquo;vaudevilles&rsquo; every
evening, with sacred music (in Lent) from Handel and
Mozart.&nbsp; The admission was no more than a shilling or
sixpence, and it is pleasing to find that the &lsquo;junior
branches of families&rsquo; were admitted at threepence a
head.&nbsp; One has a tender feeling for these junior branches,
some of whom must have sat there with their fathers and mothers
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>rather
wearily from 7.30 to near 11, enlivened at times by the conjurer
and the lady on the elastic cord (Miss Hengler or Miss Clarke)
but caring little for the excellent glees and the vocal efforts
of Miss Fraser James&mdash;bright star though she was of the
London tavern concerts <a name="citation59a"></a><a
href="#footnote59a" class="citation">[59a]</a>&mdash;or for those
of Miss Smith, &lsquo;the little Pickle&rsquo; of Drury Lane, of
whom the critics remarked that it was miraculous that so young a
person should be able to sing so high and so low, and excel in
such songs as the &lsquo;Deep, Deep Sea&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Wolf,&rsquo; which she was understood to sing in private.&nbsp;
How many people at this period visited the Eagle, or, indeed, any
other place of open-air amusement, it is hard to determine; but
the newspapers speak of 5,000 or 6,000 persons being present on
one night in May, while others give the more modest total of
1,000 or 1,300 at sixpence each.&nbsp; The frequenters of the
Eagle were people of humble rank, and at this time we hear of no
distinguished visitors, except, perhaps, Paganini, who, going
there with his friends to amuse himself one August night in 1832,
was considerably mobbed, the remarks on his appearance being
doubtless gems of Cockney sarcasm.</p>

<p>A graphic sketch by &lsquo;Boz&rsquo; brings back to us the
evening when Mr. Samuel Wilkins, the journeyman carpenter of
small dimensions, accompanied his sweetheart, Miss Jemima Evans,
to the Eagle.&nbsp; On their way from a distant suburb, they
stopped at the Crown<a name="citation59b"></a><a
href="#footnote59b" class="citation">[59b]</a> in Pentonville, to
taste some <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>excellent shrub in the little garden thereto attached,
and finally arrived in the City Road.&nbsp; The Eagle garden was
gravelled and planted, the refreshment-boxes were painted, and
variegated lamps shed their light on the heads of the
company.&nbsp; A Moorish band and military band were playing in
the grounds; but the people were making for the concert-room, a
place with an orchestra, &lsquo;all paint, gilding, and plate
glass.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here the audience were seated on elevated
benches round the room, and &lsquo;everybody&rsquo;&mdash;and
this is a touch of the later Dickens&mdash;&lsquo;was eating and
drinking as comfortably as possible.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins
ordered rum-and-water with a lemon for himself and
&lsquo;sherry-wine&rsquo; for the lady, with some sweet
caraway-seed biscuits.&nbsp; There was an overture on the organ
and comic songs (let us add by the famous singers Henry Howell

<p>This must have been in 1835 or 1836, and Dickens would have
been pleased at the all-embracing sympathies of the proprietor of
the Eagle, who, a little later, organized so many charitable
benefits.&nbsp; Thus, there was a benefit for the Blind Hebrew
Brethren in the East, and a ball &lsquo;for our friends of the
Hebrew nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another night, a benefit &lsquo;to
relieve decayed Druids and their wives and orphans,&rsquo; and
yet another night &lsquo;for clothing the children of the
needy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, like the previous
coronation, gave a hint for new developments.&nbsp; The Eagle
now, and for some years, took to itself the sub-title of the
Coronation Pleasure-Grounds, and this year, or at the <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>close of
1837, the place assumed nearly the form that it retained till its
closing years.&nbsp; A covered promenade ran round the gardens;
the great tavern at the corner of the City Road was erected, and
a ball-room was completed.&nbsp; The Saloon was remodelled, with
a pit&mdash;part of it railed off for smokers&mdash;and tiers of
boxes.&nbsp; A new organ was set up by Parsons of Bloomsbury, and
the old organ and self-acting piano were advertised for
sale.&nbsp; The architectural genius of Rouse was doubtless at
the bottom of these changes, but he gave the credit to the
professionals, and announced that the whole was &lsquo;planned by
P. Punnett, Esq., and surveyed by R. Warton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The new Saloon was opened on January 1, 1838&mdash;for the
Eagle was a winter as well as a summer resort <a
name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a>&mdash;with a concert and an
appropriate address by Moncrieff the dramatist.&nbsp; A programme
of this year includes an overture by Weber, an air from Rossini,
&lsquo;Tell me where is Fancy bred,&rsquo; &lsquo;All&rsquo;s
Well&rsquo; (duet), and &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, Mr.
Ferguson,&rsquo; one of several comic songs.</p>
<p>We approach the forties, when Rouse, like Phelps with
Shakespeare at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, had the audacity to present
a whole series of operas in the City Road.&nbsp; If these
representations were not brilliant, they were praiseworthy
efforts, and a revelation to East Central London.&nbsp; Rouse had
a good band and chorus; an excellent tenor in Frazer from Covent
Garden Theatre; C. Horn, the composer of &lsquo;Cherry
Ripe,&rsquo; Russell Grover, and various passable prima donnas.
<a name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a>&nbsp; Among the operas announced in
the bills of the forties we find the <i>Barber of Seville</i>,
the <i>Crown Diamonds</i>, <i>Don Giovanni</i>, <i>La Gazza
Ladra</i>, and <i>Sonnambula</i>.&nbsp; In these attempts to
improve the musical taste of the neighbourhood, Rouse is reported
to have lost &pound;2,000 yearly, but as the tavern brought him
in about &pound;5,000 a year he could well afford the
experiment.</p>
<p>At the Christmas of 1844, pantomime, which was to make <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the fame of
the later Grecian theatre, found its place in the programme, and
Richard Flexmore, a really agile, inventive, and humorous clown,
made his appearance.&nbsp; A more remarkable actor, who joined
the Grecian company about this time, and remained with it for
five years, was Frederick Robson, who was given parts in the
farces and vaudevilles.&nbsp; Robson&rsquo;s great reputation
dates from his performances at the Olympic from 1853 onwards, but
at the Grecian he had already given an unmistakable taste of his
quality.&nbsp; His famous song &lsquo;Villikins and his
Dinah&rsquo; was first heard at the Eagle.&nbsp; A man of strange
physique, with a small body and a big head, he could do what he
would with his audience&mdash;convulsing them with laughter by
some outrageous drollery; thrilling them with &lsquo;an
electrical burst of passion or pathos, or holding them midway
between terror and laughter as he performed some weirdly
grotesque dance.&rsquo; <a name="citation62a"></a><a
href="#footnote62a" class="citation">[62a]</a>&nbsp; In burlesque
and extravaganza he displayed such passionate intensity that he
seemed to give promise of a second Kean&mdash;yet a Kean he never
became.&nbsp; A playgoer who saw him often has acutely suggested
that &lsquo;the very opportunity of exaggeration afforded by
burlesque elicited the display of a quasi-tragic power which
would have ceased if the condition of exaggeration were
withdrawn.&rsquo; <a name="citation62b"></a><a
href="#footnote62b" class="citation">[62b]</a></p>
<p>March 1, 1851, was memorable at the Eagle as the last night of
the proprietorship of old Thomas Rouse.&nbsp; He died at Boulogne
a year later (September 26, 1852).&nbsp; During his twenty-seven
years of management he had done much to deserve the title of
&lsquo;Bravo&rsquo; Rouse, with which his audiences were wont to
hail him.&nbsp; For one thing, he was never bored by his own
entertainments, but used to sit, night after night, in a box or
other conspicuous place&mdash;a symbol of order, armed with a big
stick, which one fancies he would have used if necessary.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>His
successor was Benjamin Oliver Conquest <a
name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a> (born 1805) a comic actor of ability,
endowed with plenty of animal spirits, which had carried him from
the part of a coach-builder or (according to others) of a
bootmaker in real life to the stage part of a witch in
<i>Macbeth</i>, and finally supported him through a twenty-eight
weeks&rsquo; repetition at the Pavilion Theatre of a song,
&lsquo;Billy Barlow,&rsquo; which made a sensation something like
&lsquo;Jim Crow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He inaugurated the first night of his management at the Eagle,
March 31, 1851, by the production of <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream</i>, with an opening address by E. L. Blanchard.&nbsp; On
another night Blanchard&rsquo;s burlesque, called <i>Nobody in
Town</i> was produced with a part for Sam Cowell
(1820&ndash;1866), the comic singer, famous for his clear
articulation and finished style.&nbsp; The great feature of
Conquest&rsquo;s management was the production of ballets, only
surpassed by those of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; It
happened that Mrs. Conquest, his wife, was a fine dancer and a
singularly skilful teacher, who trained a long succession of
pupils, including the graceful Kate Vaughan.&nbsp; The Miss
Conquests, moreover, his daughters Amelia, Laura, and Isabella,
formed in themselves a small troupe of capable dancers.&nbsp; In
the gardens, too, the public dancing became more prominent, and a
&lsquo;monster platform&rsquo; was erected for the accommodation
of 500 people.&nbsp; The masked ball was also occasionally tried,
an experiment, as Vauxhall had shown, likely to be fraught with
rowdyism, though the Eagle sternly refused admittance to clowns,
harlequins, and pantaloons.&nbsp; One sensation of
Conquest&rsquo;s management was the ascent, in 1852, of
Coxwell&rsquo;s balloon, with the acrobats H. and E. Buislay
suspended on a double trapeze from its car.</p>
<p>In the last years of the fifties, pantomime and drama,
romantic and sensational, figure largely in the bills.&nbsp; From
1857 George Conquest, the proprietor&rsquo;s son, began to take a
prominent part as actor and stage-manager, and finally made the
Grecian pantomime one of the features of the <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>minor
stage.&nbsp; In conjunction with H. Spry, the younger Conquest
wrote or produced more than twenty-one pantomimes at this
theatre, and was always to the fore in the performance
itself.&nbsp; Unsurpassed in daring feats of the trap and trapeze
kind, he was no less remarkable for his wonderful make-up and
changes.&nbsp; In the <i>Wood Demon</i> (1873&ndash;1874), for
instance, he presented the title-r&ocirc;le as a tree, appearing
next as a dwarf, an animated pear, and finally as an
octopus.&nbsp; He became sole proprietor on his father&rsquo;s
death (July 5, 1872), and built a new Grecian theatre, <a
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a> opened in October, 1877, with Harry
Nicholls; George Conquest, junior, and Miss M. A. Victor in the
company.</p>
<p>In 1879 Conquest sold the Eagle property to Mr. T. G. Clark,
taking his farewell benefit on March 17.&nbsp; He migrated to the
Surrey Theatre, where, as lessee, he continued the traditions of
the Grecian pantomimes.&nbsp; He died on May 14, 1901.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, the new proprietor, <a name="citation64b"></a><a
href="#footnote64b" class="citation">[64b]</a> had made money in
the marine-store business, and would have been better qualified
to command the Channel Fleet than to manage the Eagle.&nbsp; He
had, it is true, been for a short time the lessee of the Adelphi,
but he had no eye for theatrical business, and his new venture,
chiefly in the regions of melodrama, was once more disastrous to
his pocket.&nbsp; Perhaps the failure was not entirely his own
fault.&nbsp; Tastes were changing, and the Eagle garden, with its
public dancing&mdash;now that Cremorne had passed
away&mdash;seemed something like a scandal or an
anachronism.&nbsp; In the time of the Conquests there had been
complaints of the company that frequented the Eagle.&nbsp; Such
charges are too often exaggerated, because they are often made by
well-meaning people who really know nothing <i>at first hand</i>
of popular amusements, and who go to the <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>garden or the
music-hall to collect evidence, as it were, for the
prosecution.&nbsp; At the same time, there is generally something
in complaints of the kind, nor are managers quite the immaculate
beings that their counsel represent them to be when licences come
on for renewal in October.&nbsp; It is right to say that George
Conquest seems to have done his best to keep out notoriously bad
characters, and that he warned mere boys and girls off his
monster platform and his concert-hall.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark&rsquo;s difficulties and the belief, well founded or
not, that the Eagle was an undesirable public influence formed
the opportunity of &lsquo;General&rsquo; Booth and the Salvation
Army.&nbsp; The Army wanted a barracks and a headquarters for
their social and religious work.&nbsp; That they should have
obtained these&mdash;and largely by public subscription&mdash;few
will complain.&nbsp; But it is not quite clear that it was
imperative to make an onslaught on the Eagle, being, as it was, a
centre of amusement in the colourless life of the district.&nbsp;
A new theatre might well have arisen under a new Conquest, even
if the garden and the dancing had to go.</p>
<p>In June, 1882, the Eagle was purchased by the Army.&nbsp; In
August the stage appliances were sold off, and the Army entered
the citadel in triumph.&nbsp; In September the public were
admitted.&nbsp; A great tent for religious services took the
place of the monster platform&mdash;the pernicious spot on which,
as Mr. Booth&rsquo;s friends declared, so many &lsquo;had danced
their way to destruction.&rsquo;&nbsp; Curiously enough, though
one object of the movement was to annihilate the Eagle tavern,
that stronghold of beer-drinking and spirit-drinking, Mr. Booth
discovered that the law compelled him to keep up the drinking
licence, and beer is sold in the Eagle public-house at this very
moment.&nbsp; Unfortunately, also, for its funds, the Army got
involved in litigation about alterations and repairs&mdash;a
costly business which was carried up to the House of Lords.</p>
<p>At last the ancient domain of the Shepherd and Shepherdess <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>was deserted
even by the Salvation Army.&nbsp; In September, 1899, the
newspapers announced that the Eagle premises were in the hands of
the house-breakers.&nbsp; A few old frequenters hastened to
revisit the place, and some others, no doubt, who had only heard
of the Eagle as a somewhat low resort associated with that
enigmatic song of their childhood, &lsquo;Pop goes the
Weasel,&rsquo; must have been surprised to find the
buildings&mdash;rather handsome in their way&mdash;still in
existence.&nbsp; The Eagle garden presented itself to such
visitors as a large paved square, which, judging from its two
surviving trees, could never have been truthfully described as
thickly wooded.&nbsp; Conspicuous features were the large rotunda
opposite the entrance, with its pit, now floored over, and the
&lsquo;new&rsquo; theatre (of 1877), adjoining Shepherdess Walk,
practically unaltered, though dingy and dirt-begrimed beyond
description.</p>
<p>The Oriental orchestra in the garden still showed traces of
its gaudy colouring, and a melancholy brick wall displayed
remnants of primitive grotto-work.&nbsp; One could trace near the
centre of the grounds the concrete-covered circle where many a
light-hearted couple had danced before the days of the Conquests.
<a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a>&nbsp; The rows of alcoves, with the
balcony for promenaders above them, were still there, though no
longer brightly painted, but mostly boarded up and filled with
headless Venuses and Cupids&mdash;pagan deities of the gardens
who nourished <i>circa</i> <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1838&ndash;1882.</p>
<p>Soon after this, the huge Eagle tavern, surmounted by its
proud stone bird, was demolished, and a smaller public-house of
neat red brick (opened August, 1900) now covers part of its
site.&nbsp; On the site of the theatre and its entrance, which
faced Shepherdess Walk, and was adorned with two more stone
eagles, we have now a police-station.&nbsp; Though all the old
buildings have been destroyed, much of the garden space is still
unoccupied, and in due season a solitary tree puts forth its
leaves.</p>

<h2><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>THE
ALBERT SALOON AND ROYAL STANDARD PLEASURE-GARDENS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his own Shepherdess Walk&mdash;a
little to the north of the Eagle&mdash;the enterprising Thomas
Rouse had a not unsuccessful imitator in the person of one Henry
Bradley, the proprietor of the Royal Standard tavern and
pleasure-gardens.&nbsp; Some entertainments and concerts were
given here in the early thirties, but the fame of the place, such
as it was, belongs to the forties.</p>
<p>At the end of 1838 Bradley began to adorn his gardens somewhat
in the manner of the Eagle, surrounding them with boxes, alcoves,
and panoramic views, and building the new saloon for concerts and
plays which became well known as the Albert Saloon.&nbsp; He
opened the gardens on Easter Monday, 1839, announcing that they
would accommodate 10,000 persons, of whom 4,000 were sure of
shelter from the rain.&nbsp; Concerts, vaudevilles, and
melodramas were for several years the staple of attraction, and
the admission was usually not more than sixpence.&nbsp; Tom
Jones, a mimic and comic singer, was the manager, and something
was done in the way of fireworks, ballooning, and weekly
dances.</p>
<p>At the gardens of this period the mild attraction of a balloon
ascent was often heightened by suspending from the car some
living object&mdash;a pony, a donkey, or a man.&nbsp; The
balloonist Gypson, who ascended from the Standard gardens in
1839, varied this device by attaching to his night-balloon
&lsquo;a model of the late Royal Exchange.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, as the balloon was rising, the &lsquo;late Royal
Exchange&rsquo; caught fire and was burnt to ashes in the
grounds, <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>though the aeronaut cut the rope and soared on high in
safety.</p>
<p>As a minor theatre, the Albert Saloon never attained the
well-deserved fame of its Grecian rival.&nbsp; But it is fair to
say that in one week of 1846 it presented the tragedy of
<i>Venice Preserved</i>, the tragedy of <i>Othello</i>, and
<i>Cato</i>&mdash;not, indeed, Addison&rsquo;s, but
&lsquo;<i>Cato</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>The Slave&rsquo;s Revenge</i>,
a romantic drama.&rsquo;&nbsp; To relieve the tension of this
trying time, the drama of the <i>Jail Bird</i> was enacted, and
Jack Sheppard and Rookwood were at one time or another found to
be the taste of the Albert audiences.</p>
<p>The Albert Saloon had also its pantomimes, and for several
years the noted clown, Paul Herring, was in its company.&nbsp;
Herring had begun life, like other famous artists, by performing
daily&mdash;and innumerable times daily&mdash;in
Richardson&rsquo;s show at Bartholomew Fair.&nbsp; He came to the
Albert Saloon in 1839, and was afterwards clown at the Victoria
and other theatres.&nbsp; In his later days he subsided into the
lean and slippered pantaloon, a part that he played in the Drury
Lane pantomime of 1877, the year before his death.</p>
<p>The glory of the Albert appears to have waned at the end of
the forties, and the place was closed about 1857, and the Royal
Standard, a public-house numbered 106, Shepherdess Walk is now
its only representative. <a name="citation69"></a><a

GLOBE PLEASURE-GROUNDS, MILE END ROAD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> New Globe tavern, No. 359, Mile
End Road, was and is (though somewhat altered)&mdash;a
substantial building, with a fine golden globe still keeping its
balance on the roof.&nbsp; From the twenties or thirties <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a> till the sixties it had some spacious
grounds in the rear, entered from an archway beside the
tavern.&nbsp; These grounds contained fine trees, and were
prettily laid out with many fountains, statues, and rustic
boxes.&nbsp; On the west of the grounds was the Regent&rsquo;s
Canal, and the whistling and puffing of the Eastern Counties
Railway in the background were, for a time, looked on as amusing
novelties.&nbsp; Houses in Whitman Road and Longfellow Road (at
the back of the tavern) now cover the site of these grounds.</p>
<p>In 1831 the Mile End New Globe Cricket Club was formed here,
and in 1835 we hear of its beating the fashionable Montpelier
Club. <a name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a>&nbsp; The garden had its concerts and
occasional ballets, and its ballooning, of which a tale is told
by Henry Coxwell, aeronaut, who made a series of ascents from
this place.&nbsp; On a summer day in 1854 he received an
unexpected summons for a balloon display.&nbsp; It was the
benefit night of Francis, the manager, and Coxwell was <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>anxious to
oblige.&nbsp; But his balloon had just been oiled and it was a
warm evening&mdash;too warm for the safety of the balloon.&nbsp;
Yet a balloon had been promised and fireworks.&nbsp; About eight
o&rsquo;clock an anxious consultation took place in the gardens,
and the concert, on Coxwell&rsquo;s suggestion, was prolonged
till it was pitch dark in the grounds.&nbsp; The gardens were now
crowded, and there were impatient cries for lighting up.&nbsp; At
last, after a little more delay, the reluctant balloonist was
seen to enter&mdash;or rather to be pushed headlong
into&mdash;the car.&nbsp; But all went well: the balloon
ascended, its occupant bowed and waved his flag, and in a burst
of fireworks was quickly lost to view.&nbsp; While all this was
in progress a man, evidently suffering from a terrible cold, for
he was greatly muffled up, and wearing whiskers&mdash;could they
be false whiskers?&mdash;might have been seen anxiously skirting
the edge of the crowd and making the best of his way to the Mile
End Road.</p>
<p>Mr. Francis&rsquo;s benefit was a success, but the next day
there arrived at the New Globe a worthy farmer, bearing in a
basket Coxwell&rsquo;s duly ticketed balloon, which had descended
in his field.&nbsp; &lsquo;Greatly obliged to you,&rsquo; said
the proprietor.&nbsp; &lsquo;No lives lost, I hope?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No lives,&rsquo; said the farmer; &lsquo;there was none to
lose.&nbsp; The fellow found by my man Joe was thought to have
expired, yet all the life he ever had was out of him; but <i>you
know</i> and <i>I know</i> that he never had any,
mister.&rsquo;&nbsp; The farmer spoke the truth: <i>the Globe
balloonist was a dummy</i>!</p>

<h2><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>THE
RED HOUSE, BATTERSEA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> picture the Red House and its
surroundings, one must put out of sight the fine park of
Battersea, and go back to the first fifty years of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; At that time there stood near the riverside,
facing the south end of the present Victoria (or Chelsea
Suspension) Bridge, a picturesque tavern of red brick, with white
pointings and green-painted shutters.&nbsp; On a summer day the
pleasantest place for alfresco refreshment was a small jetty in
front of the tavern, beneath the elm-trees and the flagstaff that
flew the colours of the house.&nbsp; On the east side was a
garden with spacious boxes and arbours.</p>
<p>The Red House was the favourite goal of many Thames races, but
in the twenties, thirties, and forties its fame was chiefly due
to its shooting-ground, an enclosure about 120 yards square,
where the Red House Club and the crack shots of the Metropolis
were accustomed to meet.&nbsp; Pigeons were sold for the shooting
at fifteen shillings a dozen, starlings at four shillings, and
sparrows at two shillings.&nbsp; When sportsmen like Mr.
Bloodsworth and Mr. &lsquo;O.&rsquo; were on the spot the
execution was deadly.&nbsp; Thus, in 1832, in the first match at
30 birds each, each shot 28; in the second, B. killed 25, O. 23;
and in a third match B. killed his 25, and O. his 22.</p>
<p>At one time a half-witted man called Billy the Nutman drove
his little trade near the Red House, and for a few pence would
stand in the water while sportsmen of the baser sort took shots
in his direction.&nbsp; Here, at any rate, pigeon-shooting did
not encourage humanity or a sense of humour.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>A nicer
habitu&eacute; of the Red House was the raven Gyp, the treasure
of the landlord, Mr. Wright. <a name="citation73"></a><a
href="#footnote73" class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; Gyp was not,
indeed, universally beloved, especially by the prowling dogs of
the neighbourhood, on whom he pounced with beak and claw.&nbsp;
He was, moreover, not inexpert in thieving, and had, in many
hiding-places, deposited the spoons and pairs of spectacles
snapped up in leisure moments.&nbsp; He had also formed a coin
collection by swooping down on the sixpences and shillings placed
on the bar by customers paying their reckoning.&nbsp; He was a
talking bird, but indulged neither in fatuous endearments nor
horrid oaths.&nbsp; He was, in truth, a practical joker of the
finest feather.&nbsp; His human &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a
clock?&rsquo; elicited an answer from many a Cockney oarsman as
he passed the Red House; and his &lsquo;Boat ahoy!&nbsp; Our
Rock, over!&rsquo; could be heard across the river.&nbsp; Now, at
the White House (opposite the Red) was stationed a ferryman named
Rock, and even Mr. James Rock was sometimes deceived.&nbsp; Twice
on one day he had crossed to the Red House to answer the call of
a non-existent passenger, but the third time he caught the raven
in the act, and flung the handiest missile&mdash;a pewter
pot&mdash;at the mischievous bird.&nbsp; The landlord was
enraged, though Gyp escaped; but it was probably owing to this
incident that Gyp was removed to a Midland county, where, in the
absence of Cockneys and ferrymen, he pined away and died.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The frequenters of the Red House were not all
pigeon-shooters.&nbsp; Around it extended the drear and marshy
waste of Battersea Fields, abounding in plants many and curious,
but also in strange specimens of humanity.&nbsp; In the early
years of the nineteenth century an informal fair was held at
Easter in the Fields; in 1823 it was prohibited, but the spirit
of fairing was not dead, and from 1835 onwards the fair became
perpetual, and especially vigorous on the Day of Rest.&nbsp; A
Battersea missionary, the Rev. Thomas Kirk, states his
recollections of this fair as follows: &lsquo;If ever there was a
place out of hell which surpassed Sodom and Gomorrah in <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>ungodliness
and abomination, this was it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
gone,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;to this sad spot in the afternoon
and evening of the Lord&rsquo;s Day, when there have been from 60
to 120 horses and donkeys racing, foot-racing, walking matches,
flying boats, flying horses, roundabouts, theatres, comic actors,
shameless dancers, conjurers, fortune-tellers, gamblers of every
description, drinking-booths, stalls, hawkers, and vendors of all
kinds of articles.&rsquo;&nbsp; It would be impossible to
describe the &lsquo;mingled shouts and noises and the
unmentionable doings of this pandemonium on earth.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>This is graphic enough, but perhaps a trifle severe, for it
will be noted that in the worthy missionary&rsquo;s indictment
the donkeys and the roundabouts are hardly less heinous counts
than the gambling and the unmentionable doings.&nbsp; However
this may be, Battersea Fields for years not only outraged the
notion of a quiet Sunday, but in the summertime attracted by
thousands the choicest specimens of the <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>loafer, the
&lsquo;gypsey,&rsquo; and the rowdy.&nbsp; It might have been
left to the local builder to cover the objectionable fields with
bricks and mortar, but a better way was found.&nbsp; In 1846 an
Act of Parliament empowered the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests to form a park in the Fields, and in 1850 the Red House
and its shooting-ground were purchased by them for
&pound;10,000.&nbsp; But the landlord (James Ireland) and the
fair people had still two years to run.&nbsp; Mr. Ireland, on his
part, considerably forced the pace, and made his garden into a
minor Vauxhall, where we hear of balloons and fireworks, a
ballet, a circus, a dancing-platform, and a tight rope.&nbsp; All
this must have been on a humble scale, for sixpence and
threepence were the highest charges.&nbsp; It was in 1852 that
Mr. John Garratt raced Mr. Hollyoak from the Old Swan to the Red
House for &pound;5, their boats being washing-tubs drawn by
geese.&nbsp; Nothing is new in &lsquo;amusements,&rsquo; and even
this silly contest was as old as 1844, when John Barry, the clown
of Astley&rsquo;s, had conducted (in full canonicals) a similar
craft from Vauxhall to Westminster. <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; As another
attraction Ireland introduced the pedestrian Searles to perform
the dismal feat of walking 1,000 miles in 1,000 consecutive
hours.&nbsp; Mr. Searles walked for six weeks, from July 7 to
August 18 (1851), and an ox was roasted whole in the grounds to
celebrate his achievement.&nbsp; A monster loaf, a plum-pudding
weighing a hundredweight, and a butt of Barclay&rsquo;s best,
were at the same time presented to the public.&nbsp; A calf, a
fat sheep, and a prime pig were promised for future Sundays.</p>
<p>The fair was suppressed by the magistrates in May, 1852, and
from this time the formation of Battersea Park went slowly on
till its formal opening on March 28, 1858.&nbsp; It occupies 198
acres of the old Fields, and has absorbed, besides the Red House,
some other places of resort&mdash;the Tivoli Gardens on the river
front, and the Balloon tavern and gardens in the marshland.</p>

77</span>BRUNSWICK GARDENS (OR VAUXHALL PLEASURE-GARDENS),
VAUXHALL</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">These</span> beautiful grounds,
once the resort of Royalty,&rsquo; were opened by a Mr. King in
1839, and flourished for a few years, till about 1845.&nbsp;
Their famous neighbour &lsquo;Vauxhall&rsquo; was no longer what
it had been, and in 1840 was actually closed for a year.&nbsp;
There was thus an opening for a &lsquo;Minor Vauxhall&rsquo; with
summer concerts <i>&agrave; la Musard</i>.</p>
<p>A band of from thirty to fifty performers was engaged under
Blewitt as director and composer, and the grand gala concerts
twice a week were hardly inferior to those of Vauxhall as it then
was.&nbsp; Operatic and dance music, and plenty of ballads and
comic songs, formed the programme.&nbsp; The comic singer was the
popular Henry Howell; the other vocalists are not much known to
fame&mdash;Mr. Hart and Mr. Frost, and two ladies, Mademoiselle
Braehem and Miss Gieulien, who seem to have modelled their names
on those of better-known musicians.&nbsp; The concerts were
followed by Darby&rsquo;s fireworks and by ascents of Montgolfier
balloons, which, &lsquo;on reaching a certain height,&rsquo;
discharged parachutes, and themselves descended quietly into the
gardens, instead of wandering off to risky trees and ponds in
remote English counties.&nbsp; The admission was a shilling or
sixpence, with refreshments, and in 1840 the experiment was tried
of admitting ladies free.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The resort of Royalty&rsquo; to the gardens was
legitimately inferred from the fact that the grounds were at the
back of Brunswick House, the former residence of the Duke of <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>Brunswick.&nbsp; The local resident entered his
pleasure-garden from the Wandsworth Road, and respectfully
skirted the house and its private grounds till he reached a
spacious lawn at the back.&nbsp; This was bordered on two sides
by rustic boxes and refreshment bars, and by an orchestra and
assembly-room.&nbsp; The pleasantest feature of the garden was a
promenade platform erected on piles over the Thames.&nbsp; Close
by was the river entrance and the pier of the Vauxhall Hotel, at
which the steamboats from Hungerford Market and the City landed
visitors at about seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Brunswick House, an ugly but spacious brick mansion (No. 54,
Wandsworth Road), is still standing, and is now used as a Club
for the employ&eacute;s of the London and South-Western
Railway.&nbsp; The garden space is absorbed by yards and
wharves.</p>

GARDENS, CAMBERWELL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> gardens, entered from the
Wyndham Road, Camberwell, had a brief but lively existence from
1849 till about 1857.&nbsp; A central walk, adorned with
fountains and lawns on either hand, led to a ball-room on the
right, and on the left to a maze described as &lsquo;the nearest
to that of Hampton Court.&rsquo;&nbsp; This maze was intricate
and verdant, and provided with a competent guide, while in the
middle&mdash;in which respect it surpassed &lsquo;that of Hampton
Court&rsquo;&mdash;it had a magic hermitage inhabited by a
learned Chaldean astrologer.</p>
<p>Concerts and dancing took place every evening in the summer,
the admission being sixpence.&nbsp; On special occasions there
were costume balls with a large band.&nbsp; From 1851 to 1854
James Ellis, the former lessee of Cremorne, was manager.&nbsp; He
gave a ball <i>&agrave; la Watteau</i>, and in 1854 repeated Lord
Chief Baron Nicholson&rsquo;s &lsquo;1,000 guineas
f&ecirc;te,&rsquo; <a name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a> which had the genuine, and slightly
risky, Nicholson flavour.&nbsp; It lasted three days, and
included a steeplechase by lady jockeys, a Coventry procession by
torchlight, with Lady Godiva and other characters sustained
&lsquo;by artists&rsquo; (presumably not R.A&rsquo;s) &lsquo;from
the Royal Academy.&rsquo;&nbsp; There were also Arabian
Nights&rsquo; entertainments, and a mock election for Camberwell,
in which the candidates addressed the free and independent voters
from the hustings.</p>
<p>On Sundays the Flora Gardens granted free admissions, and a
representative of <i>Paul Pry</i> who visited the place in 1857
describes the local frequenters.&nbsp; Polly P*rs*ns was, <a

81</span>MONTPELIER TEA GARDENS, WALWORTH</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> gardens, attached to the
Montpelier House tavern, came into existence in the later years
of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; William Hazlitt, the essayist
(born in 1778), recalls with pleasure his &lsquo;infant
wanderings&rsquo; in this place, to which he used to be taken by
his father. <a name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a></p>
<p>In July, 1796, the newly formed Montpelier Club played their
first match in their cricket ground at Montpelier Gardens; and on
August 10 and 11 of that year the same ground was the scene of a
match of a rather painful, if curious, character.&nbsp; The game,
like all the cricket of the period, had high stakes dependent on
it&mdash;in this case 1,000 guineas&mdash;and the players were
selected (by two noble lords) from the pensioners of Greenwich
Hospital: eleven men with one leg against eleven with one
arm.&nbsp; The match began at ten, but about three a riotous
crowd broke in, demolished the gates and fences, and stopped the
proceedings till six o&rsquo;clock, when play was resumed.&nbsp;
On the second day the elevens reappeared, being brought to the
scene of action in three Greenwich stage-coaches, not without
flags and music.&nbsp; The match was played out, and the
one-legged men beat the poor one-arms by 103. <a
name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>In the
first thirty years of the nineteenth century the place had
considerable local reputation as a tea-garden, and was noted for
its maze.&nbsp; It did not become extinct till the end of the
fifties.</p>
<p>In 1828 one of the attractions by day and by candle-light was
the waxworks booth of the Messrs. Ewing, &lsquo;consisting of 129
public characters, large as life.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this
collection, omitting minor celebrities, were to be seen George
IV. in his chair of state; the lamented Princess Charlotte; Guy
Fawkes, who attempted to blow up the Parliament House; the
Archbishop of York; Wallace, the hero of Scotland; &lsquo;the
unfortunate John Bellingham&rsquo;; and Daniel Dancer, &lsquo;the
miserable miser,&rsquo; with his sister and servant.&nbsp; There
was, moreover, a likeness of the celebrated living skeleton,
&lsquo;procured at enormous expense and difficulty&rsquo;
(presumably to the skeleton).&nbsp; &lsquo;Those who
delight,&rsquo; said the bills, &lsquo;in the wonders of the
Creator will no doubt be highly gratified, without enduring that
unpleasantness which some have complained of when viewing the
being himself [<i>i.e.</i>, the skeleton].&rsquo; <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a></p>
<p>The gardens were to the west of the present Walworth Road, a
little to the south-west of Princes Street.&nbsp; The Montpelier
tavern and Walworth Palace of Varieties (No. 18, Montpelier
Street) is on part of the site.</p>

<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>THE
SURREY ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">view</span> here reproduced represents
these once famous gardens as they appeared in the early
thirties.&nbsp; They were in existence, somewhat transformed, as
late as 1877, but it is now difficult to imagine that they were
situated in a populous region between the Kennington and Walworth
Roads.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Zoo&rsquo; which found a home in a beautiful garden
in the south of London was for some time no mean rival to the Zoo
<i>par excellence</i> in Regent&rsquo;s Park, while, as a place
of public entertainment, the Surrey Gardens had something of the
popularity of Cremorne, with which they were, in fact, nearly
coeval.&nbsp; But here the resemblance ends, for the Surrey Zoo
had no dancing-platform, <a name="citation83"></a><a
href="#footnote83" class="citation">[83]</a> no alcoholic drinks
for more than thirteen years, and rarely furnished to the
police-court reporter any copy worthy of his notice.&nbsp; The
gardens were generally closed at 10 p.m., and the addition in
1846 of two new constables to the permanent staff was advertised
as an effective terror to evil-doers.&nbsp; The gardens were by
no means solely frequented by South Londoners, though they were
far from the luxurious west, and on the wrong side of the
Thames.&nbsp; Fireworks, promenade concerts and ballooning were a
bait for the shillings of the sightseer, but for more than twenty
years at least these attractions never quite sophisticated the
simple recreation afforded by the Zoological Garden.</p>

<p>The founder, and for many years the proprietor, of these
gardens was Edward Cross, whose menagerie at Exeter <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Change was
once a London sight and the abode of the famous elephant
Chunee.&nbsp; But Exeter Change, as old views of London clearly
show, projected itself in an obstructive way across the pavement
of the Strand, and in 1829 was removed for the formation of
Burleigh Street.&nbsp; Mr. Cross then moved his animals to a
temporary home in the King&rsquo;s Mews (the site of Trafalgar
Square).&nbsp; In the autumn of 1831 the menagerie found itself
in South London.&nbsp; The Manor-House, Walworth, had attached to
it a fine garden of fifteen acres and a lake of three acres, <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a> which was not only a picturesque
feature, but, as we shall afterwards see, a valuable theatrical
asset as &lsquo;real water.&rsquo;&nbsp; The owner of the
Manor-House had already spent several thousands on his grounds,
and it was not difficult for Cross to make the necessary
alterations.&nbsp; The gardens were remodelled or laid out anew
by Henry Phillips, author of <i>Sylva Florifera</i>, with
flower-beds, walks, and undulating lawns, and an early guidebook
to the gardens gives a list of its two hundred varieties of hardy
trees.&nbsp; Aviaries were soon put up for the singing birds, and
swings and cages for the parrots.&nbsp; The water-birds readily
took to the little ponds, and the swans and herons were soon at
home in the Great Lake, where they found an island haven overhung
by drooping willows.&nbsp; The lions and tigers were caged in a
great circular conservatory of glass (something like the
palm-house at Kew), 300 feet long, and constructed nearly in the
centre of the grounds.&nbsp; A still larger octagon building with
enclosed paddocks was erected for the zebras, emus, and
kangaroos.</p>
<p>The <i>Companion</i> to the gardens, issued in 1835, duly sets
forth the catalogue of the animals and birds, and many numbers of
the <i>Mirror</i> magazine give neat woodcuts of the
&lsquo;latest additions,&rsquo; at that time apparently rare or
curious, though now sufficiently familiar.&nbsp; The greatest
popular successes were the three giraffes&mdash;the first ever
seen in England&mdash;brought over in 1836 from Alexandria; the
orang-outang; the Indian one-horned rhinoceros (1834); Nero, the
lion who <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>cost &pound;800, and was stated to be twenty years old;
and a gigantic tortoise, which small children used to ride.</p>
<p>The Zoological Garden was inaugurated under distinguished
auspices, and the prospectus of 1831 proclaims as patrons the
Queen, the Duchess of Kent, the Princess Victoria, and an
imposing array of Dukes and Marquises.&nbsp; The season tickets
were a guinea, and the admission at the gates was from first to
last one shilling.&nbsp; In this prospectus nothing was said
about popular amusements, and for several years nothing much was
done in this direction beyond anniversary f&ecirc;tes of the
fancy fair description.&nbsp; On such occasions performers like
Ramo Samee, the sword-swallower, and Blackmore of Vauxhall made
their appearance, Blackmore&rsquo;s function being to cross the
lake on a rope sixty feet high.</p>
<p>In 1837 the South London Horticultural Society, formed in the
preceding year, held the first of many successful flower-shows in
the gardens.&nbsp; In the same year the first panorama was
displayed&mdash;&lsquo;Vesuvius, with the town and port of
Posilippo.&rsquo;&nbsp; The lake was, of course, the Bay of
Naples, with feluccas and a miniature British frigate lying at
anchor.&nbsp; The painter of Vesuvius, as of many of the later
panoramas, was George Danson, the scene-painter at
Astley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Danson was a clever artist in his way; his
panoramic drawing was good, and his colouring well kept under, so
that his productions would bear inspection by daylight.&nbsp; At
night-time the fireworker of the gardens, J. Southby, appeared on
the scene, and Vesuvius was soon in eruption.&nbsp; On the day
when the first eruption was to take place the manager of the
gardens&mdash;if <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i> is not misleading
us&mdash;solemnly warned the chief fireman of the City, in case
he should send to Walworth engines that might be more needed
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Vesuvius was repeated in 1838, and henceforth the Surrey Zoo
was never without an exhibition of the kind.&nbsp; It is a good
rule always to see a panorama or a big model whenever one has the
opportunity, but the reader will perhaps be contented if I set
forth the chronology of the <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Surrey panoramas in a footnote. <a
name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a>&nbsp; However carefully painted the
canvas might be, a subject was preferred that lent itself to
treatment by gunpowder and fireworks.&nbsp; Thus, Vesuvius was
followed by Mount Hecla; Old London was burnt in the Great Fire
of 1666; Gibraltar was besieged; Badajoz stormed &lsquo;with
effects of real ordnance&rsquo;; and the taking of Sebastopol was
truly terrific.</p>
<p>The city of Rome (covering five acres) was a favourite
subject.&nbsp; The scene showed the bridge over the Tiber, St.
Peter&rsquo;s, and the Castle of St. Angelo.&nbsp; At night-time
Southby&rsquo;s fireworks legitimately reproduced the Roman
Girandola of Easter Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the Surrey Menagerie every one knows<br
/>
(Because &rsquo;tis a place to which every one goes)<br />
There&rsquo;s a model of Rome: and as round it one struts<br />
One sinks the remembrance of Newington Butts;<br />
And having one&rsquo;s shilling laid down at the portal,<br />
One fancies oneself in the City Immortal.&rdquo; <a

<p>Balloon ascents, which had such a strange fascination for the
frequenters of Vauxhall in the thirties and forties, and which
were always an attraction at Cremorne, do not seem to have been a
feature of the Surrey Gardens.&nbsp; An ascent by Henry Coxwell,
on September 7, 1854, was of some importance, as the balloonist
for the first time gave a public exhibition of his methods of
balloon-signalling in war.&nbsp; His apparatus was attached to
the car, and the signals were supposed to be addressed to the
beleaguered fortress of Sebastopol.&nbsp; Some pigeons were also
taken up, and sent forth from the balloon with messages.</p>
<p>Two curiosities of ballooning are connected with these
gardens.&nbsp; In May, 1837, Mr. and Mrs. Graham took up in a
parachute attached to their balloon a monkey named Signor Jacopo,
attired in a scarlet coat and feathers.&nbsp; The monkey
descended in his parachute on Walworth Common, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>and, being
duly labelled with &lsquo;two pounds reward,&rsquo; was promptly
returned to Mr. Cross.&nbsp; In 1838 the appearance of the
&lsquo;Montgolfier&rsquo; balloon <a name="citation88a"></a><a
href="#footnote88a" class="citation">[88a]</a> excited no
ordinary interest.&nbsp; It was a monstrous machine made of lawn
varnished, and was said to be &lsquo;of the height of the York
Column, with a circumference nearly half that of the dome of St.
Paul&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was announced to ascend on May 24,
and people began to assemble in the grounds at noon.&nbsp; By
seven o&rsquo;clock there were nearly 5,000 spectators, and,
behind a huge tarpaulin, the balloon was supposed to be in
process of inflation.&nbsp; The balloon was attached to a
platform in the middle of the lake, and its peculiarity was that
it had to be inflated by chopped straw burnt in a brazier under
the orifice of the bag.&nbsp; The size of the furnace had been
miscalculated, and after the balloon had twice been set on fire,
the &lsquo;intrepid aeronaut&rsquo; decided not to ascend.&nbsp;
Some of the spectators considered that, at any rate, the balloon
could be punished, and &lsquo;a well-directed volley of
stones&rsquo; soon left the monster prostrate on the lake.&nbsp;
An attempt was made to drag it on shore and tear it in pieces,
but at this moment the cord broke.&nbsp; Some of the rowdier
spirits now sought out the proprietor, hoping to duck him in one
of his own ponds.&nbsp; And when this failed, they attacked the
glass panes of the lion&rsquo;s conservatory.&nbsp; But suddenly
the police appeared and Vesuvius burst forth in all its fury, and
when the fireworks were over the visitors quietly dispersed.</p>
<p>From 1839 to 1844 orchestral concerts, without vocalists, were
one of the principal attractions.&nbsp; A good band, under C.
Godfrey, performed music of the promenade-concert
type&mdash;operatic overtures, dance-music by Strauss and Musard,
with an occasional &lsquo;classical&rsquo; first part, when
Handel and Beethoven had their turn.</p>
<p>In 1844 there was a change of proprietors.&nbsp; Edward Cross
retired, <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a> and was succeeded by William Tyler,
who had been <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>the secretary to the gardens.&nbsp; Next year a gigantic
and very ugly orchestra was erected for the accommodation of a
band of 300 under Jullien, <a name="citation89"></a><a
href="#footnote89" class="citation">[89]</a> who had made a name
by his promenade concerts at Covent Garden and Drury Lane.&nbsp;
Post-horn gallops and polkas now enlivened the multitude, and in
this &lsquo;Concert monstre&rsquo; the brass too often got the
better of the strings.&nbsp; Some vocalists (Mlle. Lovarny and
Miss Huddart) were also introduced (1848).&nbsp; These concerts
and the panoramas bring us to 1855, which was practically the
last year of the <i>old</i> Zoo.&nbsp; For Tyler then disposed of
his property, and sold off the wild beasts.&nbsp; The popular
taste was no doubt changing, though Tyler had done his best, and
lit up the glass conservatory so that (as his advertisements
stated) the &lsquo;matchless collection of carnivora could be
viewed by gaslight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The gardens were now taken in hand by the Surrey Music-Hall
Company, who had a working capital of over &pound;30,000, and
rented the gardens for &pound;346.&nbsp; The chairman of this
company was Sir W. de Bathe, but Jullien had a considerable stake
in the enterprise.&nbsp; At a cost of &pound;18,200 a music-hall
(in the classical sense of the word) was erected near the lake,
on the site of the circular conservatory.&nbsp; This building, by
Horace Jones, was on a great scale, and would hold an audience of
12,000 and an orchestra of 1,000.&nbsp; Its general appearance
was not ineffective, but a critic described its style as
degenerate Italian relieved in the French taste.&nbsp; It was
opened on July, 15, 1856, with a performance of &lsquo;The
Messiah,&rsquo; with Jullien, Clara Novello, Sims Reeves, Miss
Dolby, and Piatti.</p>
<p>In the autumn the new hall had a strange tenant in Mr. C. H.
Spurgeon, who, finding Exeter Hall and his own chapel too small,
hired the building for four Sundays for a payment of &pound;15
each Sunday.&nbsp; On the evening of <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>October 19 there was an enormous
congregation.&nbsp; While Spurgeon was engaged in prayer an
extraordinary panic occurred.&nbsp; Some mischief-maker raised a
shout of &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; or, according to another account,
there was an agonized cry of &lsquo;The roof!&nbsp; The
roof!&rsquo;&nbsp; A mad rush was made for the doors, some of
which seem to have been locked to prevent people strolling in and
out of the gardens.&nbsp; Spurgeon kept calm, and, when the
terror subsided, some of the congregation found their way back to
the hall, but seven persons had been killed and about fifty
injured in the crush.</p>
<p>The new company was soon in difficulties, and in August of
1857 the directors were behindhand with their rates.&nbsp; At a
meeting of the shareholders Jullien complained bitterly that,
though a profit of &pound;1,000 had been made, he was given no
money to pay his band.&nbsp; He had lost&mdash;as he put
it&mdash;&pound;2,000 by his unpaid salary, and &pound;2,000 by
his worthless shares.&nbsp; In 1859 there was a more modest
orchestra of sixty, and the Surrey Gardens Choir performed
madrigals; but in the background there were proceedings in
Chancery, and in April the gardens&mdash;now described as of ten
acres&mdash;were advertised for sale.&nbsp; In June, 1861, the
music-hall was burnt out, and though in the following year a
picture of the Bay of Naples was offered to the public, the life
of the gardens was wellnigh extinct.&nbsp; It happened that at
this time (1862) the authorities of St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital
had to leave their old home in Southwark, and needed a temporary
resting-place.&nbsp; They had the music-hall rebuilt, and used it
for the reception of patients until 1871.&nbsp; Then the new
hospital was opened on the Albert Embankment.</p>
<p>The gardens nearly outlasted the seventies.&nbsp; In May 1872,
an enterprising lessee, Frederick Strange, who had been manager
and proprietor of the Alhambra, opened the gardens for concerts,
operettas, and ballets. <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; The grounds
had become a wilderness, and had to be considerably
&lsquo;improved.&rsquo;&nbsp; The theatre was the old music-hall
remodelled.&nbsp; <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>At the opening concert Mme. Marimon and other members of
Mapleson&rsquo;s opera company appeared, and Sims Reeves and Mme.
Patey sang at one of the ballad concerts.&nbsp; But in 1873 the
entertainments were fashioned on those of Cremorne.&nbsp; There
were Derby and Oaks &lsquo;Festivals&rsquo; in May, and that
unfortunate nobleman, &lsquo;Sir Roger Tichborne,&rsquo; was
announced to appear in the theatre.&nbsp; In September there was
a gala with &lsquo;50,000&rsquo; lamps for the benefit of Robert
Duffell, who had for half a century illumined Vauxhall, Cremorne,
and smaller public gardens.</p>
<p>In 1875 the lessees were Messrs. Poole and Stacey, who
produced comic opera and ballet.&nbsp; Captain Boyton this year
exhibited the life-saving apparatus with which he had crossed the
Channel.&nbsp; In 1877 a new manager or lessee, John Reeves,
offered for a sixpenny admission an open-air dancing-platform, a
variety entertainment, and the sight of a Canadian ox of 400
stone.&nbsp; The last regular entertainment took place in the
theatre on August 14, 1877.</p>
<p>In March, 1878, the theatre was hired for a single
performance, a boxing match between Rooke and Harrington.&nbsp; A
rough company of 800 people were got together, and the prize, a
splendid silver vase valued at &pound;100, was ostentatiously
displayed to the audience.&nbsp; An old &lsquo;Surrey&rsquo;
waiter who was present is said to have recognized in this noble
trophy a capacious <i>leaden</i> vessel which had stood on one of
the refreshment counters in the water-drinking days of the
Zoological Gardens. <a name="citation91"></a><a

Simpson bought the property in 1846, and put in James Ellis to
act as manager.&nbsp; But other accounts speak of Ellis as the
real lessee, 1846&ndash;1849, and this seems to be correct,
because, when Ellis became bankrupt in 1849, execution for
&pound;8,000 was levied upon Cremorne.&nbsp; Ellis&rsquo;s
unsecured debts amounted to over &pound;16,000, of which
&pound;250 was due to a confiding Cremorne waiter.&nbsp; The rent
of the gardens had been &pound;582 per annum, and there was an
unpaid gas-bill for &pound;665.&nbsp; Simpson was certainly
proprietor from 1850 onwards to 1861.</p>

than on the tight-rope.</p>

gardens in Chelsea and Pimlico, in the latter district the Gun
and the Monster being the best known.&nbsp; Two others may be
briefly noticed:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">New Ranelagh and Minor Vauxhall,
Millbank</span>.&mdash;These gardens were near the river, and
occupied a small space between the Belgrave Docks Wharf and
Ranelagh Road.&nbsp; Part of the engineering works of James
Simpson and Co., Limited (101, Grosvenor Road, Pimlico), now
covers the site.&nbsp; They were advertised from about
1809.&nbsp; In the summer months (1809, 1811) there were
&lsquo;grand galas&rsquo; and balls, with concerts, and fireworks
by Signora Hengler, the fireworker to Vauxhall Gardens.&nbsp; The
admission tickets for the balls were neatly executed (see pp. 27,
28), but cost only 2s. 6d., and the dancers can hardly have been
of the rank of the famous Chelsea &lsquo;Ranelagh,&rsquo; which
had come to an end in 1803.&nbsp; In 1810 and 1811 the
proprietors gave a silver cup for sailing matches.&nbsp; The
gardens retained some popularity till about 1829 (<i>Picture of
London</i>; tickets, cuttings, etc., in the writer&rsquo;s
collection).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Flask, Ebury Square</span>.&mdash;An
old tavern, of which there are various mentions in the eighteenth
century (Crace, <i>Catal.</i>, p. 311, No. 59; Beaver&rsquo;s
<i>Chelsea</i>, p. 307).&nbsp; In the thirties it had a
tea-garden with a colonnade overgrown by creepers running round
two sides of the garden, and a fine fountain.&nbsp; A skittle
club played in the garden or in a covered pavilion
adjoining.&nbsp; The tavern seems to have been demolished about
1868, when Ebury Square was partly rebuilt.&nbsp; There is an
engraving of &lsquo;The Flask Tavern,&rsquo; showing the garden,
published in 1837 by J. Moore, from a drawing by H. Jones.</p>

gratuitously various soup-kitchens for the poor of London, and
established model kitchens at Scutari and in the Crimea during
the war of 1855.&nbsp; G. A. Sala says of him: &lsquo;He was a

(from 1840, or earlier) had their ground at the Beehive,
Walworth.&nbsp; In 1844 the Beehive ground was required for
building purposes, and the club obtained a lease (March, 1845) of
the Oval, and in a year or two was merged in the Surrey County
Club.&nbsp; The Beehive public-house, now 62, Carter Street (on
the east of the site of the Surrey Gardens), represents an old
tavern (1779 or earlier), which had about five acres of ground
attached to it, with a tea-garden.&nbsp; In these gardens the
balloon of the ill-fated Harris (see <i>supra</i>, p. 58) was
exhibited in 1824 (<i>cf.</i> H. H. Montgomery&rsquo;s
<i>Kennington</i>, p. 169 <i>f.</i>).&nbsp; The old Beehive
tavern was a long, low building with a veranda.&nbsp; In the
garden was a maze and the original proprietor&rsquo;s cottage,
connected with the adjoining fields by a bridge over a
stream.&nbsp; Mr. Wemmick&rsquo;s Walworth residence in <i>Great
Expectations</i>&mdash;a toy-house with a bridge&mdash;may be

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
